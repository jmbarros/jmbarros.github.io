My blogging frequency may be down over the next few weeks. Just like the old saying, "When it rains, it pours," I've been hit with a truckload of things to get done over the next few weeks that are really going to demand a great deal of my time. Don't get me wrong; I'm thankful for the work and the opportunities. It's just a lot of work! I've been invited to speak at a vendor conference in early November (sorry, I can't share which vendor) and need to finalize that presentation, I'm traveling later this week, and I have other deadlines at work that must be met. Unfortunately, that doesn't leave a whole lot of time for this site.

Within the next couple of weeks, though, things should lighten up and return to normal. So, don't despair---updates will come! After more than 3 years of blogging here, I wouldn't be too worried about the site withering away due to lack of updates.

Thanks for your continued support!
