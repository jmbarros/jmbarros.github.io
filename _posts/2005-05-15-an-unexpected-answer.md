Have you ever prayed a prayer, only to have God answer that prayer in the most unexpected, most unplanned way possible? Today, on Pentecost Sunday, the day in which we celebrate the giving of the Holy Spirit, God answered a prayer for me. In one of those really weird ways that only make sense when viewed through the eyes of faith, God blessed me with a burden. And through this burden I will have the opportunity to show His love, His grace, and His mercy. Praise the Lord.
