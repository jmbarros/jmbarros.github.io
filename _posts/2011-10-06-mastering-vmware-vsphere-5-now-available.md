I'm very excited to announce that both Kindle and paperback copies of _Mastering VMware vSphere 5,_ the eagerly-anticipated vSphere 5 book, are now available [from Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Mastering-VMware-vSphere-Scott-Lowe/dp/0470890800). At the time of this writing, the Kindle version was priced higher than the paperback version, but I'm hoping that Amazon---who solely controls pricing for Kindle books---will drop the price soon.

The book is also available from other outlets and in other formats, if you're interested:

* Barnes and Noble [has the book](http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/mastering-vmware-vsphere-5-scott-lowe/1104178103?ean=9780470890806&itm=1&usri=vsphere%2b5) both in paperback and as a NOOK book.

* The book is available [as an iBook through iTunes](http://itunes.apple.com/us/book/mastering-vmware-vsphere-5/id469623066?mt=11), if you'd prefer to get it in that format.

* You can also get it directly from the publisher [as an Adobe E-Book](http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1118180127.html) or [in paperback form](http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0470890800,miniSiteCd-SYBEX.html).

One of the complaints of _Mastering VMware vSphere 4_ was that the electronic formats weren't fast enough coming, so we've really tried to address that this time around.

Thanks, and I hope you enjoy the book!
