Although the title may indicate otherwise, I'm actually glad to see more browsers popping up for [Mac OS X](http://www.apple.com/macosx/). Choice is good.

The new kid on the block this time is [Shiira](http://hmdt-web.net/shiira/index-e.html), a WebKit-based browser that offers some pretty useful features. These features include Tab Expose, which is Expose for browser tabs (activated via F8); [Growl](http://www.growl.info/) integration; integration with Safari Bookmarks; and a clean, native Aqua interface. Because it uses Apple's WebKit (now open sourced and available [here](http://webkit.opendarwin.org/)), it renders pages the same way as Safari.

I like some features about Shiira (especially the Growl integration and the tabbed browsing implementation), but still find myself going back to [Camino](http://www.caminobrowser.org/). A new alpha version of Camino 0.9 has been released, although I haven't brought myself to use it yet. If Camino had a way to provide notifications via Growl (I'd really like for my browser to notify me when a download is complete), I would be just absolutely thrilled.

Oh, and Shiira is an open source project, released under a BSD style license.
