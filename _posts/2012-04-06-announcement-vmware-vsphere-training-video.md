In my [2012 projects post][1], I alluded to some "new projects" that I wasn't quite ready to discuss. As you can guess by the title of this post, this is one of those new projects! I'm very excited to announce that I am working with [Train Signal](http://www.trainsignal.com/) to create a video training course strictly focused on **designing VMware vSphere environments**. In fact, the name of the new video training course is "Designing VMware Infrastructure."

Creating a video training course is completely different from anything I've done before. I'm comfortable speaking in front of groups (I've spoken at multiple VMworld conferences and numerous full-day VMUG conferences all around the world), but recording a video training course isn't quite the same. Nor it is like writing a book. (Strangely enough, I _almost_ think writing a book is easier!) However, part of the theme in my 2012 projects is about expanding into new areas and new things, so this fits right in with that theme.

In addition, this video training series is a great complement to _VMware vSphere Design_ (available [here](http://www.amazon.com/VMware-vSphere-Design-Forbes-Guthrie/dp/0470922028/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1333731832&sr=8-1) on Amazon), the book I co-authored with [Forbes Guthrie](http://www.vreference.com/) and [Maish Saidel-Keesing](http://technodrone.blogspot.com/). (Stay tuned for some potential news on this front, too.)

Work is already underway on the video training course, which should be available near the end of June (only a few months away!). Look for more information as I progress through the course, and I'll be sure to make an announcement when the course is actually available.
