I have a variety of links and articles, mostly security related, that aren't really substantial enough for a full-blown entry, but I wanted to mention them anyway.

* Vulnerabilities have been [uncovered in a variety of Cisco products](http://www.darkreading.com/document.asp?doc_id=99086&f_src=darkreading_section_318), ranging from the web interface in their routers to their Call Manager software. In addition, the VPN 3000 series VPN concentrators are [open to a denial of service (DoS) attack](http://www.darkreading.com/document.asp?doc_id=99959&f_src=darkreading_section_318).

* There's some question about the recent MS06-035 patch released by Microsoft and whether it [actually patches the vulnerability](http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1996667,00.asp). The MSRC (Microsoft Security Response Center) blog insists that proof of concept (PoC) code released after MS06-035 [exploits a new vulnerability](http://blogs.technet.com/msrc/archive/2006/07/28/443837.aspx). I'm not sure which is worse--Microsoft failing to properly patch, or that a new vulnerability has been discovered?

* Apple has [released a new security update](http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=304063), fixing a number of vulnerabilities in various components.

* Supposedly, a [Mac OS X](http://www.apple.com/macosx/) laptop [will be/was hijacked via Wi-Fi](http://blog.washingtonpost.com/securityfix/2006/08/hijacking_a_macbook_in_60_seco_1.html) at the Black Hat Conference today. Security researchers are trying to bring attention to security flaws in device drivers, an often-overlooked portion of many operating systems.

**UPDATE:** Apparently, the Wi-Fi hijacking of an Apple MacBook was indeed demonstrated yesterday; see this [updated article](http://blog.washingtonpost.com/securityfix/2006/08/hijacking_a_macbook_in_60_seco.html).
