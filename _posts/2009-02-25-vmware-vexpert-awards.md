Today, VMware awarded their vExpert Awards, an award intended to highlight those IT professionals who have supported the VMware community through user groups, blogs, forums, tools, and other means. Quoting from John Troyer's [official announcement](http://blogs.vmware.com/vmtn/2009/02/vmware-vexpert-awards.html) on the VMTN Blog:

>Email went out tonight informing around 300 hard-working bloggers, user group leaders, and virtualization evangelists of all types that they had received a VMware vExpert Award. VMware vExperts were chosen on the basis of the contributions they had made to the community of VMware and virtualization users in 2008.

I am honored to announce that I was one of the recipients of a 2008 VMware vExpert award for my community contributions during 2008. I thank everyone in the community for their nominations and their support, and I hope to be able to continue to support the community moving forward in the future as well. Thanks to everyone!

More information about the VMware vExperts can be found on the [vExpert landing page](http://www.vmware.com/communities/vexpert/).
