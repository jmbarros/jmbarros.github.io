There's a lot of buzz about Unity, a future [VMware Fusion](http://www.vmware.com/products/beta/fusion/) feature that, if real, completely trumps Parallels' [Coherence](http://www.parallels.com/products/coherence/) functionality. The question: Is Unity real or fake?

The VMTN Blog posting ["Coherence? Meet Unity"](http://blogs.vmware.com/vmtn/2007/06/coherence_meet_.html) seems to be the source of it all, which lends a certain air of credibility. The idea was quickly picked up by [The Unofficial Apple Weblog (TUAW)](http://www.tuaw.com/2007/06/06/vmware-fusion-unity/), [CrunchGear](http://crunchgear.com/2007/06/06/windows-apps-in-os-x-is-this-what-leopard-can-do/), and [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIApJMzGzDQ), among others.

However, this is an apparent about-face from the position of Fusion developers earlier in the product's lifecycle, who were not so keen on implementing such a feature in Fusion until "they could do it right." Has that time finally come?

I will say this: if Unity is truly real and coming in a future release of Fusion, and if the features that were demonstrated in the Unity video are real, it completely blows away Coherence.

**UPDATE:** [According to Regis](http://compfusion.blogspot.com/2007/06/leapfrogged.html) (VMware Fusion lead developer), this is definitely real. I stand corrected!
