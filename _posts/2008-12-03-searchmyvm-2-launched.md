VKernel has released version 2 of SearchMyVM, a search-based management tool that was [originally launched][1] back at the beginning of September. Version 2 includes a feature that is apparently the #1 "most requested" feature: the ability to export searches to CSV format for building reports that can be e-mailed or printed.

More information on SearchMyVM is available from VKernel's web site.
