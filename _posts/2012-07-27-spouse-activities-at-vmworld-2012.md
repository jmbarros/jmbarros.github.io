As most of you are well aware, [VMworld 2012](http://www.vmworld.com/) in San Francisco, CA, is nearly upon us. I, for one, am really looking forward to the conference. And along with VMworld comesthat's right, Spousetivities!

I wanted to take only a moment to highlight some of the stuff that Crystal has planned for this year at VMworld. This is the fifth year that Crystal is running activities for spouses, family members, and friends traveling with conference attendees, and she has some really great tours and activities planned:

* For those that are new to San Francisco, there will be a city walking tour on Monday that will hit the highlights: Pier 39, Coit Tower, and Ghirardelli Square, among others.

* Crystal has struck an exclusive arrangement for a very special trip to Sonoma (check out the details [here](http://spousetivities.com/2012/07/vmworld-2012-activity-highlight-sonoma-wine-and-dine/)) on Monday, if the city walking tour isn't your thing.

* On Tuesday participants can choose from a tour of Sausalito and Muir Woods (very cool if you've never been there) or a "food tour" of the Ferry Building.

* Wednesday is the Half Moon Bay/Filoli tour, which looks quite enjoyable.

* Thursday has another city tour---this time by bus with a local tour guide who is an absolute pleasure to tour with---or an extremely cool trip to Napa, with [a special pizza-wine pairing activity](http://spousetivities.com/2012/07/vmworld-2012-activity-highlight-napa-pizza-and-wine/).

Naturally, there will be plenty of giveaways, including an iPad, iPods, a computer, e-Readers like the Kindle, and more.

Why am I mentioning this? I _love_ VMworld but we all know VMworld keeps us busy from sunrise to sunset. With Spousetivities, you can bring your wife (or husband, or fiance, or domestic partner, or whatever!) with you to San Francisco, but not be concerned about keeping your loved one(s) occupied and safe. You can go enjoy the conference, and get the most out of it. That's why we go, isn't it? Taking advantage of Spousetivities gives you, in my opinion, the best of both worlds---the opportunity to enjoy the conference during the day, and the chance to enjoy the company of those you love at night.

More information on all the activities, including pricing, is available from [the VMworld 2012 Spousetivities registration page](http://vmworld2012spousetivities.eventbrite.com/).

_In the interest of full disclosure, you should be aware---if you weren't already---that Crystal, who runs Spousetivities, is my wife._
