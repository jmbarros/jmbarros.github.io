I just finished submitting my proposal for a VMworld 2007 presentation. When I first came up with the idea for this presentation, I thought it was a great idea, but the more that I worked with it the less enamored I became of it. So instead of the presentation being a "how to" on how to use this specific functionality, it became more of a discussion of advantages versus disadvantages of going down that route. I have no idea how the proposal will be received by the VMworld presentation committee, but I figured I should at least give it a try. After all, the worse that can happen is for them to say No, right?
