A short while back [NewsForge](http://www.newsforge.com/) published an article comparing Windows to Linux. What's so unusual about that, you may ask? This article, titled "[Windows rapidly approaching desktop usability](http://os.newsforge.com/article.pl?sid=05/05/18/2033216)," takes a look at Windows as if _it_, not Linux, were the upstart newcomer in the OS lineup. This is a viewpoint not often considered, and it is a valid viewpoint once you get over the **presumption** that Windows should be the default OS on your computer.

There are a couple of valid points made in the article. To quote:

>_"Microsoft Windows XP, Home Edition, with Service Pack 2, is a tremendous improvement over previous Windows versions when it comes to stability and appearance, but it still has many glitches that keep it from being competitive with GNU/Linux for everyday users, including a tedious installation procedure, lack of productivity software included with the operating system, hardware compatibility problems, and a price so much higher than any of the Linux distributions..."_

Don't get me wrong; I'm not advocating that everyone out there should suddenly ditch [Windows](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/) and migrate to Linux. Are there situations where Linux is a better fit than Windows? Of course. Likewise, there are situations where Windows is a better fit than Linux. And, of course, there's always [Mac OS X](http://www.apple.com/macosx/) to consider as well.
