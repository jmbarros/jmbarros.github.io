Mozilla released [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/) 1.0.5, which patches a number of security vulnerabilities. You can get more information on the release [here](http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1836310,00.asp) or by visiting the [Mozilla.org](http://www.mozilla.org) web site.

In addition, [more information](http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1895,1821168,00.asp) has been revealed about Firefox 1.1, the next version of the open source web browser. An alpha version of Firefox 1.1 could be ready within just a few days.

If Mozilla can continue to innovate with Firefox and address my two primary concerns---ease of deployment and distributing security updates---then they will continue to steal market share away from Internet Explorer. If nothing else, Mozilla will at least force Microsoft to be competitive again, and that is a success in and of itself.

Mozilla is also updating [Thunderbird](http://www.mozilla.org/products/thunderbird), the companion e-mail client to Firefox, and that update is expected to be available soon as well.
