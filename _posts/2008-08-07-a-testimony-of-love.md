Over three years ago, I [blogged about Shaohannah's Hope][1], a charity founded by Steven Curtis Chapman and his wife, Mary Beth Chapman. [Shaohannah's Hope](http://www.showhope.org/) is dedicated to helping further the love of Christ through the ministry of adoption.

As most everyone knows, the Chapman family recently suffered a tragic loss. Yet, even after that tragic loss, Steven Curtis Chapman, his wife, and their family still trust in God and still believe in adoption. Most recently, he penned [this commentary at CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2008/SHOWBIZ/Music/08/07/chapman.orphans/index.html), in which he says:

>If only 7 percent of the 2 billion Christians in the world would care for a single orphan in distress, there would effectively be no more orphans. If everybody would be willing to simply do something to care for one of these precious treasures, I think we would be amazed by just how much we could change the world.

My wife and I have often talked of adoption. Is it time now for us (not just my wife and me, but all of us), as Christians, to show our own testimony of love?
