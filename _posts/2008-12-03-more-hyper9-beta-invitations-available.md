If anyone is interested, I still have a few [Hyper9](http://www.hyper9.com/) beta invitations available. My [first call][1] for interested beta participants was well-received, but my available slots filled up pretty quickly. I thought there might be more people interested in trying the beta and luckily, I was able to secure a few more invites.

Hyper9 does have a few prerequisites or requirements for potential beta participants:

* Must be using VMware ESX 3.0 or higher and VirtualCenter 2.0 or higher

* Must have at least 2 VMware ESX servers

* Must have at least 20 virtual machines (VMs)

In addition, if selected, program participants must agree to install the software within 5 days of receiving it, and users from Hyper9 competitors are not eligible (duh!). Once installation is complete, users will need to notify Hyper9 at an e-mail address to be provided to them.

Do you meet the requirements? If so, and you're interested in participating in the beta, post a comment below. Be sure to use a valid e-mail address!
