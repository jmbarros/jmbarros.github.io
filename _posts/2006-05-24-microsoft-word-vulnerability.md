Security researchers recently uncovered a zero-day vulnerability in Microsoft Word that allows attackers to install a backdoor Trojan horse on the affected computers.

More information on this vulnerability can be obtained from the following links:

As described in the above articles, there are a number of ways to protect yourself against this vulnerability:

* Don't log in with administrative privileges. The exploit fails to work if the user doesn't have administrative privileges.

* Use an older version of Microsoft Office. The vulnerability only affects Word 2002/XP and Word 2003. Users of Word 2000 and earlier are apparently not affected.

* Use the Word Viewer to view documents, as the Viewer is not affected by this vulnerability.

Anti-virus vendors are updating their signatures to try to catch this, but I wouldn't rely solely upon anti-virus to protect against this vulnerability. A patch has not yet been released from [Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.com/), which anticipates releasing a patch for this issue in June.
