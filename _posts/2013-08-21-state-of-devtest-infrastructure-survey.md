While I was in the Bay Area a couple of weeks ago, I had the opportunity to sit down and chat with Navin Thadani and Shruti Bhat of [Ravello Systems](http://www.ravellosystems.com/). Ravello, as you may already know (see [this overview](http://technodrone.blogspot.com/2013/03/ravello-systems-and-bit-of-deja-vu.html) from Maish Saidel-Keesing or [this post-Toronto VMUG wrap-up](http://www.discoposse.com/index.php/2013/08/13/toronto-august-13th-vmug-event-recap-ravello-cloudphysics-log-insight-and-awesomeness/) from Eric Wright), recently went GA with their technology. It's pretty cool stuff, if I may say so.

Anyway, while we were talking Navin and Shruti mentioned that they are conducting an online survey on the current state of dev/test infrastructure. The survey is vendor-neutral, although there is an area where you can express interest in Ravello if that is the case. To help garner interest, Ravello is willing to offer the **first 100 respondents** a $20 gift certificate for Amazon.

So, if you interested in or willing to complete this survey on the current state of dev/test infrastructure, the survey is found here:

[http://nyustern.qualtrics.com/SE/?SID=SV_2uvt2ERHfSqYej3](http://nyustern.qualtrics.com/SE/?SID=SV_2uvt2ERHfSqYej3)

It should only take 5 to 7 minutes to complete. As I mentioned, if you are one of the first 100 respondents to qualify and complete the survey, you'll get a $20 gift certificate for Amazon. (Unfortunately, there's no way for the survey site to notify you whether you're one of the first 100 respondents or not.)

As soon as I hear anything about the results of the survey, I'll share them with you here. Thanks!

**UPDATE:** More than 100 respondents have already completed the survey, so there are no more gift cards. However, if you'd still like the take the survey, I'm sure that Ravello wouldn't mind. Thanks!
