I just got word this morning from a co-worker that HP has announced it will buy LeftHand Networks for about $360 million. The official HP news release can be found [here](http://www.hp.com/hpinfo/newsroom/press/2008/081001a.html) on the HP web site.

It will be interesting to see how HP integrates the LeftHand offerings into their existing storage product lines---the All-in-One  (AiO),  Modular Smart Array (MSA), and Enterprise Virtual Array (EVA) product lines. Based on HP's news release, it looks like they envision the LeftHand products fitting in between the AiO/MSA at the low end and the EVA at the high end.

With the purchase of EqualLogic by Dell and today's acquisition of LeftHand by HP, it looks like all the small iSCSI-focused startups are getting acquired by system vendors. Does this signal a trend?
