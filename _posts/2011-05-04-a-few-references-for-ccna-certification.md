It seems as if there's been a bit of an increase in interest in attaining CCNA, especially among colleagues within the virtualization and storage areas. (One could allege that this is further evidence of a growing trend away from highly specialized IT folk, but that's another topic for another day.) With that in mind, I thought I might post a few networking-related references to help others in their quest. So, with that in mind, here you go.

[Install GNS3 on Mac OS X Leopard](http://etherealmind.com/install-gns3-on-max-os-x-leopard/) (My Etherealmind)  

[Dynamips](http://etherealmind.com/category/operation/dynamips/) (My Etherealmind)  

Pretty much everything on [My Etherealmind](http://etherealmind.com/)  

[The PacketLife Community Lab](http://packetlife.net/lab/)  

OK, pretty much everything on [PacketLife.net](http://packetlife.net/)  

[GNS3 on Ubuntu 8.04 - Install Guide](http://www.the-little-things.net/?p=16) (The Little Things)  

[GNS3 Documentation](http://www.gns3.net/documentation)  

[Dynamips/Dynagen Tutorial](http://dynagen.org/tutorial.htm)  

[Free CCNA Workbook](http://www.freeccnaworkbook.com/)  

[Connecting your GNS3 labs to the real network](http://www.phocean.net/2009/03/01/connecting-your-gns3-labs-to-the-real-network.html) (Phocean.net)

This is, of course, far from extensive, and it focuses on GNS3 since I personally feel that the only truly effective way to learn something is to be hands-on with it. Since we can't all afford to have a rack full of switches and routers in our basement, GNS3 is (in my opinion) the next best thing.

Anyone else have any good suggestions to share with the readers? Let's stay away from illegitimate resources like brain dumps and test keys, and focus on informative, useful, educational resources that help readers increase their networking proficiency and prepare themselves for the CCNA certification tests. Feel free to share your suggestions and ideas in the comments.
