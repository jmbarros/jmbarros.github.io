I'll make this one short and sweet. As many of you probably already know, my wife (Crystal) has been organizing spouse activities---now affectionately called "Spousetivities"--for VMware-related conferences for a few years now. This year, she's extending Spousetivities to VMworld EMEA in Copenhagen, Denmark.

If you haven't visited [Crystal's web site](http://spousetivities.com/) to get the latest information on Spousetivities and the schedule of activities for Copenhagen, you really should. Her latest update is [available here](http://spousetivities.com/2010/10/let-the-fun-begin/) and has full information on the activities that are scheduled, the costs, and the locations. She's got a great set of activities scheduled, and thanks to her corporate sponsors (EMC, Train Signal, and HyTrust) a fair number of these activities are free on a "first come, first serve" basis. If you are attending VMworld EMEA and you haven't scheduled your spouse for some activities, do yourself a favor and go register now. You'll be glad you did!
