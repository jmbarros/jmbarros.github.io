I won't bore you with all the details again, since no doubt by now you've probably already seen the news---or perhaps I should say hype---about how the End-User License Agreement (EULA) for Leopard Server (Mac OS X Server 10.5) has changed to apparently allow for virtualization of Mac OS X Server.

Quoting the EULA from the [originating article](http://db.tidbits.com/article/9277):

>This License allows you to install and use one copy of the Mac OS X Server software (the "Mac OS X Server Software") on a single Apple-labeled computer. You may also install and use other copies of Mac OS X Server Software on the same Apple-labeled computer, provided that you acquire an individual and valid license from Apple for each of these other copies of Mac OS X Server Software.

Now, this isn't quite what I had discussed in [my last post about Apple and virtualization][1], but it is a step in the right direction. Unfortunately, the current EULA limits these virtual instances to be a) version 10.5 only; and b) Mac OS X Server only. Alas, no virtual instances of "regular" Mac OS X for geeks such as myself, and no earlier instances of Mac OS X either.

Of course, the other big question surrounds who will win the race to produce the first application to provide virtualized Mac OS X Server instances...will it be VMware or Parallels? To be honest, I'm inclined to say Parallels, but maybe Ben, Regis, and others at VMware can prove me wrong.
