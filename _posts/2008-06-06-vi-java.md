I received an e-mail from Schley Andrew Kutz earlier this week announcing the release of VI Java. In his words:

>VI Java is a set of client-side libraries designed to ease the burden of developing applications for VMware Infrastructure (VI) using the Java language. VI Java brings true OOP design to the VI SDK.

I'm no programmer, so I can't speak to how useful this may be. I can tell you that one of the examples Andrew provided in his e-mail---getting properties from a managed object---seemed vastly simpler using VI Java than the VI SDK.

VI Java is available [here on SourceForge](http://vijava.sf.net/). Andrew is deprecating his own fledgling VI Toolkit for Java to instead join forces with the developer of VI Java. VI Java is released under the BSD license.
