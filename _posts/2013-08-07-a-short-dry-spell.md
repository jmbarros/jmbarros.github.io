It's been a couple of weeks since I published anything here, so I wanted to just provide a brief update. I know that posting something about why I haven't posted something isodd, I guess you could say. In any case, a number of factors---some personal, some professional---have contributed to why I haven't been able to generate some useful new content in the last couple of weeks. Of course, there are blogs that go for months between posts, so a small gap of a couple weeks isn't really a big deal. After over 8 years (I started blogging in May 2005), I think you can rest assured that I have no intention of shutting down anytime soon.

However, despite this dry spell, I am determined to continue with my Learning NVP blog series (part 1 is [here][1]), as a great many people have expressed interest. Fortunately, I made some headway on some blockers that were preventing progress, and that gives me hope for new content soon. I'm also exploring new posts on Puppet, Open vSwitch (OVS), OpenFlow, and---who knows---maybe VMware will have some snazzy announcements at VMworld that will give me new fodder for posts. We'll see.

So, bear with me as I work through this short bout of writers' block. I hope to be back soon with some new content. Thanks!
