Many of you know that my wife, Crystal, has been organizing activities---aka Spousetivities---at VMworld since 2008. This year is no different, and [registration is already open](http://www.eventbrite.com/e/vmworld-2014-spousetivities-san-francisco-tickets-12198817993) for activities at VMworld US 2014 in San Francisco. This year Crystal has another great set of activities planned, including:

* The usual "Getting to Know You" breakfast, held again this year at Jillian's

* Mission Street food tour

* Whale watching tour

* City tour

* Wine tour including custom wine blending and wine pairing

* Kayaking on the Russian River

As in previous years, sponsors make these activities possible. This year, Spousetivities is sponsored by [VMware NSX](http://www.vmware.com/go/nsx/), [Origami Owl](http://crystallowe.origamiowl.com/collections.ashx), [vBackup](http://www.vbackup.com/), [The Virtualization Practice](http://www.thevirtualizationpractice.com/), [VMUG](http://www.vmug.com/), [HyTrust](http://www.hytrust.com/), [Xangati](http://xangati.com), and [Wine Shop at Home](http://www.wineshopathome.com/sharikeen/). The support of these sponsors is what allows Crystal to get private transportation for participants and to keep prices as low as possible.

Here's my ask:

* If you're attending VMworld and thinking of bringing a spouse, significant other, family member, or just a friend, please consider registering for Spousetivities.

* If you're someone traveling with a VMworld conference attendee, please consider registering for Spousetivities.

* If you're neither of the above, please consider helping to spread the word about Spousetivities: blog about it, tweet about it, post updates to Facebookwhatever you can do.

You can register for Spousetivities [here](http://www.eventbrite.com/e/vmworld-2014-spousetivities-san-francisco-tickets-12198817993).
