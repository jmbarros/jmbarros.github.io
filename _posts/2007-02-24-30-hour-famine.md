Approximately 11 minutes ago I started my first [30 Hour Famine](http://www.30hourfamine.org/), an event sponsored by [World Vision](http://www.worldvision.org/). Our youth group is participating in the 30 Hour Famine this year to raise money and awareness of hunger around the world; all our proceeds go to World Vision to fund their efforts.

A lot of people think that they can't make any difference against a problem like world hunger or starvation; the reality is that $1 can care and feed a child for a day. That's the message I've been trying to get across to the kids in my youth group: _everyone can make a difference._ We'll spend the entire day today fasting from food and participating in service projects to help others in need. The idea is that while helping those in need---homeless, orphans, etc.---we will ourselves be experiencing the effects of hunger. We're hoping that God will reveal Himself to us in a new way and open our eyes to His will and His purpose for us as individuals and us as a youth group.

Pray for us as we lead the youth group through the 30 Hour Famine, which runs from 7:00AM this morning to 1:00PM tomorrow afternoon (just after church), when we'll "break the fast" and reflect upon what God has shown us during our time of service and fasting.
