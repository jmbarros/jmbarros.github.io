I just saw [this headline](http://www.virtualization.info/2007/07/cisco-to-announce-first-3rd-party.html) from [virtualization.info](http://www.virtualization.info/) about [Cisco](http://www.cisco.com/) being the first to announce a third-party virtual switch for [ESX Server](http://www.vmware.com/products/vi/esx/).  Honestly, I'm not too terribly surprised.

Surely, the announcement of [John Chambers as a keynote speaker](http://www.virtualization.info/2007/07/cisco-ceo-to-deliver-vmworld-keynote.html) at VMworld 2007, followed by the [investment of $150 million](http://www.virtualization.info/2007/07/cisco-invests-150-million-in-vmware.html) by Cisco into [VMware](http://www.vmware.com/) surely had to signal that something was going on. This revelation that Cisco plans on being the first to announce a third-party virtual switch for ESX Server is honestly not a surprise. In fact, if I recall correctly, there were rumors of this last year at VMworld.

Still, despite the fact that it's not really a surprise, I'm still excited about the possibility that this is actually the case. I'm not a Cisco expert, but I'd love to have the ability to run Cisco-based switches on ESX Server (assuming the overhead isn't too significant). That should make integration of ESX Server with Cisco-based networks _much_ easier than it has been in the past. What's next---SAN switches on ESX? (I may not be too far off, there, with all the rumors and discussions about NPIV support in ESX Server.)

**UPDATE:** Ryan Glover over at p2vd.com shares his thoughts on the announcement [here](http://www.p2vd.com/?p=147).
