Two of my most-used applications have been updated to new versions. OmniGraffle is now updated to version 5.1, and OmniFocus is now updated to version 1.5. (Funny, I just noticed how the versions numbers are reversed--5.1 and 1.5.)

The [OmniGraffle](http://www.omnigroup.com/omnigraffle/) update brings one feature that I have especially been anticipating: the ability to import Windows Metafile images in Visio diagrams. This extremely useful feature, first hinted at [here][1] back in March, will tremendously ease Visio compatibility and should open up lots of Visio shapes to be used in OmniGraffle that previously were not usable. I tested this functionality this morning on a complex NetApp-VMware-IBM BladeCenter diagram from a co-worker, and it works as advertised. Future tests will see how well this functionality works in bringing Visio stencils into OmniGraffle. This is a free upgrade for current OmniGraffle 5.0 customers.

The [OmniFocus](http://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus/) update brings this GTD application's official 1.5 release, and with it synchronization with OmniFocus for iPhone. Now that both the Mac and iPhone versions support Bonjour sync---although this is not without its [own travails][2]---I find myself using them more and more. If you've been following the pre-release versions of OmniFocus (the so-called "sneaky peeks") then you won't find many new features in this official release, but users who have been waiting for the official release to upgrade are in for a real treat. As with OmniGraffle, this OmniFocus upgrade is a free upgrade for existing OmniFocus 1.x customers.
