It's that time of the year again---time for VMworld! As I've done in years past (although I'm late getting this information published this year), I'm posting my VMworld schedule here. I do this for two reasons. First, it may spur someone to look at a session that perhaps they hadn't considered before (or it may spur me to look at a different session due to feedback!). Second, I often get requests to meet, and posting my schedule here along with a link to my Google calendar helps streamline that process. So, without further ado, here it is!

Here's the link to [my Google calendar](https://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=scottlowe.org_4rbd7q8qm96fg71fhkn0vohhj4@group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America/Los_Angeles), in the event you'd like to try to schedule something with me during the conference.

As is customary, I'll be liveblogging (as live as possible, anyway) and tweeting throughout the conference. You can [follow me on Twitter](http://twitter.com/scott_lowe) for updates. During times that I have a few minutes, I'll also be tweeting about my current location in case you'd like to chat for a bit. I enjoy talking with folks, so don't be shy!

If you are interested in setting up a formal meeting with me, find a spot on my calendar (Thursday afternoon is good!) and set up a time and place to meet. Vendors, please note: meeting with you doesn't automatically mean I'm going to post an article about you or your products. I might, but I might not. Forewarned is forearmed.

I look forward to meeting new friends, seeing old friends, and learning lots next week. See you there!
