Well, it's official---I'm headed to Tech-Ed 2008 in Orlando, Florida, in early June! Microsoft was kind enough to offer me a complimentary "Press Pass" to attend, and since I was going to be in Orlando around that time anyway on vacation, I shuffled some things around to make it happen. I plan on using the time to gather as much information as possible about Hyper-V, SCVMM 2008, and related technologies. Rest assured that as much of that information as possible will find its way here.

The free "Press Pass" from Microsoft must mean a couple of things:

1. Prominent bloggers are apparently considered members of the press.
2. I must be a prominent blogger. (Woo hoo!)

This will mark my second conference of the year; the first was VMware Partner Exchange 2008 in San Diego last week (my summary of the event [is found here][1]). Of course, then we have the "big daddy" of virtualization events later in the year in Las Vegas: VMworld 2008. I haven't registered yet---I know, I really should register. But since Microsoft was kind enough to provide a free Press Pass to their event, I was kind of hoping VMware would offer a free Press Pass to VMworld as well. So, VMware, what do you think?
