It's articles like this one from NewsForge entitled [Pipes and Filters](http://technology.newsforge.com/article.pl?sid=05/06/14/1632224&from=rss) that demonstrate why I like Linux and other Unix-like operating systems (such as [Mac OS X](http://www.apple.com/macosx/)). This kind of command-line wizardry isn't nearly as possible on [Windows](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/). At least, not as far as I know.
