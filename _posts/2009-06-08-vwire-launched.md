Tripwire is launching [vWire](http://www.tripwire.com/products/vwire.cfm), a new virtualization management tool that is designed to integrate both monitoring and automation to prevent and resolve problems before they cause downtime.

vWire is built around three key principles: Monitor, Correlate, Act:

* vWire will _monitor_ the health of the virtual infrastructure, including the same level of visibility available in the physical environment.

* vWire will _correlate_ change and configuration data with event data and, in a later release, performance data.

* Finally, vWire gives administrators the ability to _act_ upon events and objects with automation tools like PowerShell.

vWire integrates into the Virtual Infrastructure Client (and the vSphere Client, I would guess) for ease of use.

In addition, Tripwire is also launching the [vWire Community](http://community.vwire.com/index.jspa), where vWire users can share information, tools, and resources.

More information about vWire is available from the [vWire web site](http://www.vwire.com/), the [vWire product page](http://www.tripwire.com/products/vwire.cfm) on Tripwire.com, and the [vWire Community](http://community.vwire.com/index.jspa).
