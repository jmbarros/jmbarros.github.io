I suppose I should go ahead and post the obligatory list of preferred [Mac OS X](http://www.apple.com/macosx/) applications. So, without further ado, here goes.

* _SFTP Client:_ I used to use [Fugu](http://rsug.itd.umich.edu/software/fugu/), but switched not too long ago to [Cyberduck](http://cyberduck.ch/). I like Cyberduck's Synchronize feature (to keep local and remote directories synchronized) and the built-in [Growl](http://www.growl.info/) support. I still keep Fugu around, but don't use it nearly as much as I did.

* _Web Browser:_ I primarily use [Camino](http://www.caminobrowser.org/), although I will use Safari from time to time. I know that [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/) is available in a Mac OS X version, but I just prefer Camino.

* _Usenet Client:_ I tried a couple of open source applications, but finally settled on [Unison](http://www.panic.com/unison/). My only complaint with Unison is that I can't post a message to a newsgroup and send a copy of the message to someone's e-mail address at the same time.

* _RSS Reader:_ Again, I tried a couple different applications (like [NetNewsWire Lite](http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/)) but was most satisfied with [PulpFiction](http://freshsqueeze.com/products/pulpfiction/). The Mail.app-like interface and built-in Growl support fit my work habits well.

* _Instant Messaging:_ The open source [Adium](http://www.adiumx.com/index.php) client won my heart, although [Fire](http://fire.sourceforge.net/) was a very close second.

* _Organization:_ [OmniOutliner](http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnioutliner/) is a great application, very versatile and very flexible. I've found numerous uses for it so far, and expect that I'll continue to find more and more ways to use this application.

* _Miscellaneous Applications:_ These applications defy any sort of categorization. The [Growl](http://www.growl.info/) notification system, the [ecto](http://ecto.kung-foo.tv/) blogging client, [Desktop Manager](http://desktopmanager.berlios.de/) virtual desktop application, and the [Cocoalicious](http://www.scifihifi.com/cocoalicious/) del.icio.us client all have a home on my PowerBook.

Of course, I can't live without [Microsoft Office](http://www.microsoft.com/mac/), [iCal](http://www.apple.com/ical/), [iSync](http://www.apple.com/isync/), [OmniGraffle](http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnigraffle/), and others. This list should at least get things started.
