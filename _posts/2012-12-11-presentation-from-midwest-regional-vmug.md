Today I had the opportunity to speak at the Midwest Regional/Kansas City VMUG User Conference in Overland Park, KS. Below is the presentation I delivered, [as hosted by SpeakerDeck](https://speakerdeck.com/slowe/keeping-up-with-the-joneses).

If you'd like a PDF version of the deck for direct download, it is available [here]({{ site.url }}/public/dl/2012-12-11-kcvmug-slides.pdf).

As always, courteous comments are both welcomed and encouraged! Feel free to speak up below.

**UPDATE:** During the blog migration in late 2014, all embedded presentations like the one originally found in this post were converted to hyperlinks.
