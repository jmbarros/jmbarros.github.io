Before I switched to [Mac OS X](http://www.apple.com/macosx/), I was a heavy duty [Windows](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/) user. I had Windows XP on my laptop, Windows 2000 on my servers, and used a Windows CE-based Compaq iPaq H3765. Since that time, I (of course) switched to Mac OS X on my laptop (a 15" [PowerBook](http://www.apple.com/powerbook/) G4 with SuperDrive); a mix of Linux, [OpenBSD](http://www.openbsd.org/), and Windows on my servers; and a Palm OS-based handheld (currently a Treo 650, previously a Tungsten T3). As a result, I still had this iPaq sitting around doing nothing. So, on a whim, I decided to install Linux on my old iPaq.

Using the [installation instructions](http://familiar.handhelds.org/releases/v0.8.2/install/) at familiar.handhelds.org, I downloaded an [Opie](http://opie.handhelds.org/) image, installed the bootloader, and reflashed the iPaq from a spare 128MB CF card (I had a CF sleeve with external battery for the iPaq). After only a few minutes (the entire process was really quite painless), I was up and running with Linux on my iPaq.

Having Linux running on the iPaq is great, but now I have to figure out what to **_do_** with this Linux-based PDA. Suggestions, anyone?
