Over the next couple of weeks, I'll start posting a multi-part review of VMware vSphere 4.

Because this is such a large product with so many different features, I've decided to break it into three or four sections. As the different parts go live on the site, the list below will be modified to link to the appropriate part of the review:

1. Overview and installation

2. Networking and storage

3. High availability and business continuity

4. Management and operations

5. Summary and wrap-up

If there is anything in particular you'd like to see covered in the review, please note your interests by posting a comment to this article. I'll do my best to accommodate all requests, but I can't make any guarantees.
