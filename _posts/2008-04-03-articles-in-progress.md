Here's a quick list of a few of the articles that I currently have in progress:

* I've been looking at the recently-announced products from Altor Networks and have their VNSA (Virtual Network Security Analyzer) running in the lab right now. Look for a short post on the product and my initial thoughts. (One piece of advice I can offer to Altor right now: use the virtual appliance OVF format and save your customers a lot of trouble.)

* I'm going to have some hands-on time with a Xsigo I/O Director over the next few weeks, so look for an article on that product.

* Prodded to action by Nick's comment in my article on [thin provisioned VMDKs on NFS][1], I'll have an article on using SnapRestore to clone VMs on NFS without losing the thin provisioned VMDKs.

* The [Active Directory integration articles][2] are getting a bit long in the tooth, so look for updates to both the Linux and Solaris integration instructions. (By the way, speaking of Solaris integration: I came across [this article](http://www.sun.com/bigadmin/features/articles/kerberos_s10.jsp) a short while ago.)

If anyone has any other topics they'd be interested in seeing me tackle, feel free to mention them in the comments below. I can't make any promises, but I'll certainly consider them!

**UPDATE:** The article on [preserving thin provisioned VMDKs with SnapRestore][3] is now available.
