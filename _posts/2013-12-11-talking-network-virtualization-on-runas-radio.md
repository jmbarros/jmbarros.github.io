A couple of weeks ago I had the privilege of joining Richard Campbell on [RunAs Radio](http://runasradio.com/default.aspx?showNum=346) to talk VMware NSX and network virtualization. If you'd like to hear us get geeky about network virtualization and where it might take our industry, head over and [listen to episode 346](http://runasradio.com/default.aspx?showNum=346). I'd love to hear your feedback!
