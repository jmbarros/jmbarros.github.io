Phil Zimmerman, the creator of PGP (Pretty Good Privacy), is back, this time working to [provide secure VoIP](http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1841509,00.asp). Apparently, Phil resurrected PGPfone, updated it with modern protocols, and has created Zfone, a prototype application that will provide encryption for voice-over-IP calls.

This will be something to watch. I agree with Phil that nobody is really paying any attention to the security of VoIP traffic moving across the Internet, and it's about time somebody thought about it.
