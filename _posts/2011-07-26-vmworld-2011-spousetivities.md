[Spousetivities](http://spousetivities.com/) is now in its fourth year at [VMworld](http://www.vmworld.com/), and Crystal (my wife and the founder of Spousetivities) has some great stuff planned for VMworld US this year. Thanks to her sponsors (in alphabetical order: [eGroup](http://www.egroup-us.com/), [EMC](http://www.emc.com/), [HP](http://www.hp.com/), [HyTrust](http://www.hytrust.com/), [Train Signal](http://www.trainsignal.com/), and [VMUG](http://www.vmug.com/)), she's been able to pull together a great collection of activities for spouses or significant others traveling with you to VMworld in Las Vegas.

Here's a quick look at some of the stuff she has planned:

* There's the usual "Get to Know You" breakfast on Monday, 8/29

* Walking tours of The Strip (north end and south end) on both Monday 8/29 and Thursday 9/1

* Grand Canyon West Rim tour on Tuesday, 8/30

* Spa treatments at the Canyon Ranch Spa on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday (8/29, 8/30, and 8/31)

* Lake Mead riverboat cruise on Wednesday, 8/31

* Combination Lake Mead/Hoover Dam tour on Thursday, 9/1

* Gourmet cooking classes with Chef Bev Lee in the afternoon/evenings on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday

Registration is required for all events, so if you haven't registered for these activities yet you'll want to head over to [the registration page](http://vmworld2011spousetivities.eventbrite.com/) ASAP. Space is limited in these activities, and registration **will be closing** before VMworld starts. Don't wait until the last minute or you'll very likely miss out!
