Heading to [EMC World 2011](http://www.emcworld.com/) in Las Vegas in May? Cool, I'll probably see you there. What's even cooler, though, is the fact that my wife, Crystal ([@crystal_lowe](http://twitter.com/crystal_lowe) on Twitter) will be, for the first time, organizing spouse activities for EMC World!

If you're a regular reader of my site you know that Crystal first launched spouse activities at VMworld 2008 in Las Vegas, and since that time her spouse activities---now known as "Spousetivities"--have become enormously popular. So, this year she's taking them to EMC World in Las Vegas!

For more details, head over to Crystal's [Spousetivities](http://spousetivities.com/) site (and follow [@Spousetivities](http://twitter.com/spousetivities/) on Twitter) and check out [her announcement](http://spousetivities.com/2011/03/lets-go-to-emc-world/).
