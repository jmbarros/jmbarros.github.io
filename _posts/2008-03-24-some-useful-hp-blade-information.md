Some time last week, one of my NetNewsWire subscriptions turned up an article titled "HP VirtualConnect" from [Brent Ozar](http://www.brentozar.com/). It turns out that Brent's blog, while heavily SQL Server-oriented, has a few nuggets of HP Blade information:

[HP C-Class Blade Chassis Review](http://www.brentozar.com/archive/2008/01/hp-c-class-blade-chassis-review/)  

[HP C-Class Blade Chassis Review Part 2: The Cisco/Brocade Interconnect Switches](http://www.brentozar.com/archive/2008/02/hp-c-class-blade-chassis-review-part-2-the-ciscobrocade-interconnect-switches/)  

[HP Virtual Connect](http://www.brentozar.com/archive/2008/03/hp-virtual-connect/)

Of course, Brent must be pretty smart since he linked back to my site...

Seriously, though, have a look at Brent's HP c-Class articles for a good overview of the product and its associated technologies.
