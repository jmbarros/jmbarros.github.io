I used to read Tom Yager's "Ahead of the Curve" column when _InfoWorld_ was still a print publication. Every month, without fail, as soon as the magazine arrived I turned right to his column. It was one of my primary reasons for reading the magazine, at least in recent years. I think it's probably safe to say that Yager's affection for Mac OS X led me to perform an evaluation of my own and, eventually, to [switch to Mac OS X myself][1] based on the results of that personal evaluation.

But then the magazine turned digital/online only, and I stopped following his column. I already had enough stuff coming in to my various digital inboxes, and didn't really need another. Part of the allure of the column had been precisely that it **wasn't** digital.

Fast forward to just the other day, when I stumble across his column once more and find that I, too, am "ahead of the curve." In his recent article [The next best thing to OS X](http://weblog.infoworld.com/yager/archives/2007/10/the_next_best_t.html), Yager claims that Sun Solaris 10 is a great fit for places where Mac OS X isn't.

Given that I have embarked upon a plan to [learn Solaris][2], it's kind of nice to see an "industry analyst" say that you're making the right move and that you, too, are ahead of the curve.
