Last year I had the opportunity to attend Cisco Live in Las Vegas for the very first time, and it was a tremendously rewarding conference. I guess I did enough liveblogging and tweeting at the show that I garnered the attention of the Cisco Live social media team, who just shared with me a scoop regarding the guest speakers at this year's Cisco Live in San Diego.

Here's the scoop: this year's guest speakers are **none other than Jamie Hyneman and Adam Savage of the wildly popular ["Mythbusters" TV series!](http://dsc.discovery.com/fansites/mythbusters/mythbusters.html)**

As I'm sure many of you are, my family and I are big fans of the series and watch it quite frequently. I've never seen Jamie and Adam speak publicly before so I don't know how entertaining it will be, but if it's as good as the show it should be a great talk!

Hopefully I'll have the opportunity to attend Cisco Live again this year so that I can see this!

I'll update this post with a link to the official announcement as soon as the announcement goes live.

**UPDATE:** The official Cisco Live announcement page is now up and available [here](http://bit.ly/GuestIN).
