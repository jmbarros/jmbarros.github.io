I discovered another ePlus blogger today. Last week I mentioned that fellow ePlus engineer Aaron Delp has launched his site, [The Blade Blog](http://bladevault.info/) (now called BladeVault.info); today I discovered that Colin McNamara also runs [his own blog](http://www.colinmcnamara.com/) as well. Colin is a CCIE whose blog, quite naturally, focuses on networking and Cisco equipment. Most of his technical stuff is, frankly, over my head; I only know enough to get myself into trouble.

Colin's RSS feed is [here](http://www.colinmcnamara.com/feed).

**UPDATE:** I've updated Aaron's URL above to reflect the site's new location.
