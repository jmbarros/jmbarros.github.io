VMware has released an update to VMware Fusion, their Mac OS X-based virtualization product. Version 1.1.2 includes a number of fixes and new features. More information is available [here](http://blogs.vmware.com/teamfusion/2008/04/vmware-fusion-1.html).

If you're a Fusion user, go grab the free update.

I installed the update first thing this morning. I wasn't suffering from any of the problems that were fixed in this version, so I can't attest to that, but I can say that resuming and suspending VMs seems quicker. Perhaps it's just my imagination...
