VM6 Software has released VMex 2.1, a new solution built on top of Microsoft Hyper-V that blends high availability, virtual storage, simplified management, and a virtual desktop session manager into an "all-in-one software stack". Some have even compared it to the hardware stacks emerging from the VCE Coalition and others.

It's a interesting solution aimed squarely at the SMB market, where VMware has so far been relatively unsuccessful. VM6 doesn't appear to harbor any misconceptions that their solution competes directly with VMware vSphere; they are focusing almost exclusively on cost and ease of use in their solution.

For more information on the VMex 2.1 release, see the VM6 Software [press release](http://www.vm6software.com/press-releases/05/25/936).
