I came across [this great article](http://vinf.net/2008/04/09/how-does-an-hp-fibre-channel-virtual-connect-module-work/) on the HP Fibre Channel VirtualConnect module tonight. Excellent work! Combine this with [my TechTarget article](http://searchvmware.techtarget.com/tip/0,289483,sid179_gci1295274,00.html) on Ethernet networking with HP VirtualConnect and you have some good resources for using VirtualConnect in your environment.
