Back in July, I was [recognized][1] as #2 in the "Top 10 blogs that VMware administrators must read." I was honored by my inclusion in that list along with some very well-recognized names.

A couple of weeks ago, I was [recognized again](http://blogs.storagemonkeys.com/index.php/2008/09/top-10-storage-blogs-non-vendor/) in a list of "Top 10 Storage Blogs (non-vendor)" over at Storage Monkeys. And included at #2 as well---what a surprise! I am very honored to be on this list and most certainly did not expect anything like this.

Now, if I could just figure out how to get to #1...
