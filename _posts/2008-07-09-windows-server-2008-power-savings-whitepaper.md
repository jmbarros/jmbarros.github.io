I got notice of this whitepaper back during Tech-Ed but it's been sitting in my "blog posts to write when I get time" pile until now. Microsoft has posted a whitepaper ([download it here](http://download.microsoft.com/download/4/5/9/459033a1-6ee2-45b3-ae76-a2dd1da3e81b/Windows_Server_2008_Power_Savings.docx)) as well as a blog entry ([viewable here](http://blogs.technet.com/windowsserver/archive/2008/06/10/new-windows-server-2008-power-management-whitepaper-released.aspx)) regarding Windows Server 2008's new power saving functionality.

While some of the functionality is genuinely new and useful---like the monitoring of CPU utilization and throttling of CPU speed accordingly---some of the stuff in the blog entry, at least, isn't. Including Hyper-V virtualization as a "power saving feature" of Windows Server 2008 is a bit disingenuous, since any server virtualization solution will provide power savings simply from the simple fact of consolidating multiple workloads onto a single server.

If you're interested in learning more about how Windows Server 2008 attempts to reduce power usage, have a look at these resources.
