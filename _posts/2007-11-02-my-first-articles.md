Back at the start of October, about a month ago, I wrote about [an exciting new opportunity][1] that had recently opened up for me. I couldn't really disclose any details at that time, but now that everything has finally materialized into reality I can share exactly what is happening.

So here's the opportunity that I was talking about---I'm writing as a contributor for [SearchVMware.com](http://searchvmware.techtarget.com/), a new TechTarget site focused on VMware virtualization. I am really excited about this! I've written three articles so far, all of which were published yesterday:

>Many organizations that have implemented VMware Virtual Infrastructure 3 (VI3), including both ESX Server and VirtualCenter, but do not have a firm grasp of how these components handle authentication...

More articles are in the works, so be sure to stay tuned to [SearchVMware.com](http://searchvmware.techtarget.com/)! And, if you have any suggestions for future articles that should be written, please let me know. Or, better yet, register at SearchVMware.com and let me know there too!
