At the request of a few individuals, I'm posting my presentation from the Portland VMUG here. It's my first presentation on [OpenStack](http://www.openstack.org/), and hopefully I didn't mangle things too badly. Feel free to provide any corrections, clarifications, or other feedback in the comments below (courteously, of course).

Here's the presentation [as hosted on SpeakerDeck](https://speakerdeck.com/slowe/understanding-openstack).

For those that would like a direct download, it's available [here as a PDF]({{ site.url }}/public/dl/2012-11-13-pdx-vmug-ostack-slides.pdf).

Also, several readers indicated they'd like to be able to have direct downloads for some of the other presentations, so here are links to those presentations (as PDFs) as well:

[Three Technologies Worth Watching or Learning]({{ site.url }}/public/dl/2012-10-23-new-techs-slides.pdf)  

[5 Thoughts on Staying Sharp and Relevant (London)]({{ site.url }}/public/dl/2012-11-15-ukvmug-slides.pdf)

As always, I hope this is helpful in some way, and courteous comments are encouraged below.
