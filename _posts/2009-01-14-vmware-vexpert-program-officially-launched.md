While a number of other blogs broke the news about the name for this program earlier today---VMware vExpert---the [official announcement](http://blogs.vmware.com/vmtn/2009/01/are-you-a-vexpert-announcing-a-new-community-award.html) is now available on the VMTN Blog. You can also get to the official [nomination form](http://www.vmware.com/communities/vexpert/nomination_form.html), where you can nominate yourself or someone else (cough, cough, me) for a VMware vExpert award.

In case you've been hiding under a rock and aren't familiar with this program, here's more information:

>VMware is very proud to introduce the [VMware vExpert](http://www.vmware.com/communities/vexpert/) Awards. The VMware vExpert Awards will be given to individuals who have significantly contributed to the overall community of VMware users over the past year, either online or offline. You might be contributing online to blogs, forums, wikis, or other online sites. You might be organizing VMUG meetings or otherwise getting the word out to local IT professionals. You're helping spread the word about virtualization and making people successful in deploying this game-changing technology. We want to thank you.

So, if you know of someone that is worthy of a VMware vExpert award (cough, cough, me), go now and [nominate them](http://www.vmware.com/communities/vexpert/nomination_form.html)! Nominations will be accepted through midnight PST, Friday, February 6, 2009.
