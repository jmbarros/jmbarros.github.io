On May 5, I had the privilege of speaking in Charlotte, NC, at the Carolina VMware User's Summit. I had been asked to deliver a presentation on the pros and cons of stretched clusters in VMware vSphere. Since I know that not everyone could make it to Charlotte, here's a copy of the presentation I gave. It's hosted via Sliderocket. Enjoy, and feel free to post any questions or suggestions in the comments to this post. Thanks!

**UPDATE:** Access to the presentation referenced in this post was lost during the blog migration in late 2014.
