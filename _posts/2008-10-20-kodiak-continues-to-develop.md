The enterprising developers at Bluebear are continuing to develop [Kodiak](http://www.bluebearllc.net/kodiak/), the cross-platform virtualization management tool built using Adobe AIR. Yesterday morning they sent me a "special pre-release" version of Kodiak 0.0.2, assuring me that I was the first to have it. I feel special!

Unfortunately, I was at church all day yesterday and on-site with a customer all day today, so I haven't even had the chance to have a look at the new build. However, some other bloggers have had the opportunity:

The new version sounds promising. Hopefully I'll get the chance to have a look at it very soon. I don't have any beta invites---at least, I don't think I do---so don't bother asking. Sorry.
