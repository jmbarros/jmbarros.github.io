[Via VMblog.com](http://vmblog.com/archive/2008/09/03/vmware-esx-is-the-industry-s-first-hypervisor-to-be-validated-by-microsoft-offers-customers-expanded-support-options-for-microsoft-applications.aspx), I noted [this press release](http://www.vmware.com/company/news/releases/svvp.html) by VMware:

>VMware, Inc. (NYSE: VMW), the global leader in virtualization solutions from the desktop to the datacenter, today announced it has qualified its industry-leading VMware ESX hypervisor under the Microsoft Server Virtualization Validation Program (SVVP). VMware ESX 3.5 update 2 (ESX 3.5u2) is the first hypervisor to be listed under the program, providing VMware customers who run Windows Server and Microsoft applications with access to cooperative support from Microsoft and VMware.

That's right, VMware ESX 3.5 Update 2 is the **_first_** hypervisor to be validated under SVVP, as I alluded in a [previous Virtualization Short Take][1] (with [due credit to Gabe](http://www.gabesvirtualworld.com/?p=79) as well).

This is outstanding news! This now removes what is, in my mind, one of the most significant barriers to greater virtualization adoption. Full steam ahead!

**UPDATE:** In case anyone's wondering about this press release, refer to [this entry on the Windows Virtualization Team Blog](http://blogs.technet.com/virtualization/archive/2008/09/03/The-Validated-Hypervisor.aspx). They confirm that ESX 3.5 Update 2 has indeed been validated.
