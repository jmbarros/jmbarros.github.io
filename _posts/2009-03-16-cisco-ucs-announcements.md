I've been seeing lots of announcements regarding Cisco's Unified Computing System (UCS) across the Internet. Here are just a few:

[Cisco unveils its virtualization-friendly blade platform Unified Computing System](http://www.virtualization.info/2009/03/cisco-unveils-its-virtualization-blade.html)  

[Cisco and VMware teaming up: Unified Computing System](http://www.yellow-bricks.com/2009/03/16/cisco-and-vmware-teaming-up-unified-computing-systems/)  

[Cisco Announces Unified Computing System](http://www.dabcc.com/article.aspx?id=10165)

[Cisco: Unified Computing is an 'Inflection Point'](http://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/2009/03/16/cisco-unified-computing-is-an-inflection-point/)  

[Cisco's Unified Computing System - A Whole New Ballgame](http://blogs.netapp.com/jay/2009/03/ciscos-unified.html)  

[Cisco Enters the Virtual Server Hardware Market - Gestalt IT](http://gestaltit.com/tech/virtualization/stephen/cisco-virtual-server-hardware/)

I've been under strict NDA, as have many others, regarding what was formerly called "Project California," since early December. Even though the NDA is now lifted and I could speak about UCS in more detail, I'm going to reserve the bulk of my comments after the conclusion of Cisco's live webcast at 10:30AM Pacific Time (1:30PM Eastern Time).
