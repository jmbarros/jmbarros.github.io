In just a few weeks, I'll be participating in a _book sprint_ to create a book that provides architecture and design guidance for building OpenStack-based clouds. For those of you who aren't familiar with the idea of a book sprint, it's been described to me like this:

1. Take a group of people---a mix of technical experts and experienced writers---and lock them in a room.

2. Don't let them out until they've written a book.

(That really is how people have described it to me. I'll share my experiences after it's done.)

The architecture/design guide that results from this book sprint will join the results of previous book sprints: [the operations guide](http://docs.openstack.org/ops/) and [the security guide](http://docs.openstack.org/security-guide/content/). (Are there others?)

This is my first book sprint, and I'm really excited to be able to participate. It will be great to have the opportunity to work with some very talented folks within the OpenStack community (some I've met/already know, others I will be meeting for the very first time). VMware has generously offered to host the book sprint, so we'll be spending the week locked in a room in Palo Alto---but I'm hoping we might "need" to get some inspiration and spend some time outside on the campus!

Stay tuned for more details, as well as a post-mortem after the book sprint has wrapped up. Writing a book in five days is going to be a challenge, but I'm looking forward to the opportunity!
