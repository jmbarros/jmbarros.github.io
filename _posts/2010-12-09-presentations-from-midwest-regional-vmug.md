This past Monday, December 6, I had the pleasure of speaking at the Midwest Regional VMUG held in Kansas City, Kansas. I delivered two presentations on Monday:

* Next-Generation Best Practices for Storage and VMware (keynote)

* Top 6 VMware vSphere Design Questions

A number of people asked me after my presentations about getting copies of the presentations, so I'm making them available here via Slideshare. Enjoy!

Here is [a link][1] to the keynote presentation (Next-Generation Best Practices for Storage and VMware).

Here is [a link][2] to the presentation from the breakout session (Top 6 VMware vSphere Design Questions).

The full presentations for both of these sessions can be downloaded from Slideshare. Enjoy!

**UPDATE:** During the blog migration at the end of 2014, all embedded presentations had to be converted to linked presentations.
