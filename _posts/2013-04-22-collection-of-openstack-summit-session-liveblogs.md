I had the pleasure of attending the OpenStack Summit in Portland, OR last week. It was my first time at the OpenStack Summit, and it was great to meet lots of folks in the OpenStack community as well as be exposed to some more in-depth and detailed OpenStack information. While I was there I tried to liveblog as many sessions as I was able; here are links to the various session liveblogs that I managed to publish. Enjoy!

[Getting From Grizzly to Havana, a DevOps Upgrade Pattern][1]  

[Nicira NVP Deep Dive][2]  

[Considerations for Building a Private Cloud, Folsom Update][3]  

[Building HA OpenStack with Puppet in 20 Minutes][4]  

[OpenStack Capacity Planning][5]  

[Networking in the Cloud, an SDN Primer][6]  

[OpenStack Back to the Enterprise, Keep Calm and Boldly Go On][7]  

[OpenStack High Availability in Grizzly and Beyond][8]

If anyone has any other liveblog sessions that should be added to this list, drop me a comment and let me know.
