I had the privilege this past week of speaking at the Triad VMUG meeting in Greensboro, NC, along with fellow blogger, podcaster (is that a real word?), and speaker Rich Brambley. In the event you were unable to attend (there was quite a crowd attending), here's [a link to the presentation][1] I gave at the meeting.

Feel free to share any additional thoughts, questions, or comments below. Thank you!

**UPDATE:** Embedded presentations were converted to links during the migration of the blog in late 2014.
