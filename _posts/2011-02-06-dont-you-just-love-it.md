Recently...

Facilities: "We need to do some power load testing in the lab where your equipment is housed. You need to shut down your equipment."

Me: "OK, no problem. I'll shut down my equipment."

So, I go to the lab and shut down all my equipment: eight servers, four Fibre Channel switches, two Nexus 5010 switches, a fabric extender, two older (pre-CX4) CLARiiON arrays, two VPLEX clusters, and two small AX arrays.

Me to Facilities: "OK, all the equipment is shut down; you're ready to proceed with the power load testing."

Facilities: "Oh, never mind. We decided not to do the testing."

Don't you just love it?
