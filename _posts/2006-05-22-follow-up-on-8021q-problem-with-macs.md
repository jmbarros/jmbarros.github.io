Back in March, I posted an entry describing a [problem with the new Intel-based Macs on networks using VLANs and 802.1Q][1]. By all reports, that issue has now been resolved.

The [same forum that alerted me to the issue](http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?threadID=378673) in March is now reporting that the Mac OS X 10.4.6 update and/or the Intel firmware update has resolved the problem, and the massive packet loss users were previously seeing is no longer occurring. Some users are reporting success having only applied the 10.4.6 update; others indicate that both the OS update and the firmware update corrected the problem.
