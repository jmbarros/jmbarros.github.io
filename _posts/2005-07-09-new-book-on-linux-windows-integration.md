While searching for Linux-Windows integration articles to assist in my project to unify Linux authentication with Active Directory, I came across an entry in Robbie Allen's [Active Directory Cookbook blog](http://www.rallenhome.com/blog/adcookbook/) that was talking about a new book titled _Linux in a Windows World_.

Turns out that [O'Reilly](http://www.oreilly.com/) has indeed published _[Linux in a Windows World](http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/linuxwinworld/)_. Looks to be a good book; I'll have to pick up a copy soon.
