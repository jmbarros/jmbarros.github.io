Various sources ([this notice](http://www.virtualization.info/2006/08/vmware-workstation-for-mac-os-x-to.html) on [virtualization.info](http://www.virtualization.info/) and [this notice](http://www.macnn.com/articles/06/08/07/vmware.pre.registration/) on [MacNN](http://www.macnn.com/)) alerted me this morning to the [announcement by VMware](http://vmware.rsc02.net/servlet/campaignrespondent?_ID_=vmwi.1756) of a [Mac OS X](http://www.apple.com/macosx/)-based version of VMware Workstation, intended to run on any Intel-based Mac system.

I can't tell you how long I've been waiting for this (like so many others). I first [pined for virtualization on Apple][1] back in February of this year, and I'm thrilled that VMware is now stepping up to the plate to provide a Mac OS X-based version of VMware Workstation. Here's hoping they also release Mac OS X-based versions of their remote consoles as well, so that I can manage virtual machines hosted on VMware Server or ESX Server from my Mac as well.
