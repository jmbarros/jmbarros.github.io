As many of you already know, this year is the third year that my wife, Crystal, is planning activities for spouses (i.e., "spousetivites") who are in San Francisco with their VMworld-attending significant others. Crystal has even launched her own site, [Spousetivities.com](http://spousetivities.com/), where you can find more information as well.

While this information is already available on Crystal's site, in an effort to help promote awareness of some of the stuff that Crystal has put together I'm posting a calendar (of sorts) here that lists all the activities that are available for non-attending spouses.

Note that registration is required for **all** of these events, including the free "Get to Know You" breakfast. You can register for the events at [the Spousetivities Registration page](http://spousetivities.eventbrite.com/). There is a fee/cost to participate in some activities. Visit the registration page to sign up and pay for activities.

Here's the list of activities that are available:

_8/29:_ Monterey/Carmel tour, 8:00AM-6:30PM

_8/30:_ Free "Get to Know You" Breakfast at Jillians, 8:00AM-10:00AM - **Registration required!**  

_Spouses who register for this free breakfast also get a free Spousetivities T-shirt (please specify your size on [the Spousetivities Registration page](http://spousetivities.eventbrite.com/)) and a gift bag full of cool stuff._

_8/30:_ Wine Country tour, 10:00AM-6:00PM (Optional private lunch)  

_If you use the discount code "winetime" when registering you get a $25 discount. Use the discount code "winetimelunch" to get $10 off the private lunch. Limited discount quantities are available!_

_8/30:_ Photographic tour, 10:00AM-2:00PM

_8/31:_ Sausalito Houseboat tour, 9:15AM -3:00 PM (Optional private lunch)  

_Use the discount code "houseboatlunch" to get a free private lunch on this tour---a $55 value! Limited discounts available!_

_9/1:_ Photographic tour, 9:00 AM - 1:00 PM

_9/1:_ Muir Woods/Sausalito tour, 9:00AM-2:45PM (Optional private lunch)

_9/2:_ Wine Country tour, 9:00AM-5:00PM (Optional private lunch)

_9/2:_ Muir Woods/Sausalito tour, 9:00AM-2:45PM (Optional private lunch)

_9/3:_ Monterey/Carmel tour, 8:00 AM-6:30 PM

A quick note on the "Optional private lunch": these are gourmet lunches reserved only for Spousetivities attendees. In addition, all these events sport private motorcoach transportation. These aren't your typical tours!

If you are at all interested in any of these activities, please sign up ASAP---if there aren't enough attendees, some of these tours will have to be canceled. In particular, Crystal is trying very hard to get attendees signed up for the Monday Wine Country tour and the Tuesday Sausalito houseboat tour, so take a look at those and use the discounts that are available. (If you're interested in hanging out with Crystal, she'll be attending those two tours.)

If you need additional information, Crystal can help you out. She's available on Twitter (follow [@Spousetivities](http://twitter.com/spousetivities/)), you can visit [the Spousetivities Registration page](http://spousetivities.eventbrite.com/) for more details on the tours and register, you can visit the [Spousetivities site](http://spousetivities.com/) and interact with Crystal there, or you can drop Crystal an e-mail (address is available on the About page of her site).
