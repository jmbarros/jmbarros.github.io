I was so busy yesterday with meetings, VMworld sessions, and other obligations here in San Francisco that I missed out on some important news and posts:

* Thanks to fellow liveblogger [Eric Sloof](http://www.ntpro.nl/blog/archives/218-VMware-Unveils-VMware-Tools-as-Open-Source.html), I learned that VMware has released the majority of the VMware Tools as open source. A SourceForge site ([http://open-vm-tools.sourceforge.net/](http://open-vm-tools.sourceforge.net/)) has been established for the project. The [official VMware press release](http://www.vmware.com/company/news/releases/tools.html) is here.

* Mike Laverick of RTFM Education published a [great post on VMware Site Recovery Manager](http://www.rtfm-ed.co.uk/?p=428), with more details on how VMware SRM works and how it interoperates and integrates with VirtualCenter and the rest of VI3. Definitely worth a read! I'm looking forward to more technical details on VMware SRM. So far there's been lots of discussion, but I'm a technical guy---I want technical details.

* I had a good conversation with Jeff Woolsey, the Microsoft Windows Virtualization Program Manager, about Windows Server Virtualization and its hypervisor architecture in comparison with VMware's hypervisor architecture. I have more research to do yet before I comment more on that particular comparison, but I do appreciate Microsoft (both Jeff and Patrick O'Rourke of Microsoft) taking the time to speak with me and address some of my questions about their architecture. Both Jeff and Patrick contribute at the [Windows Server Division Weblog](http://blogs.technet.com/windowsserver/).

Hopefully, I'll more coverage today of the various sessions for which I'm scheduled, so stay tuned to the site for more information. As always, feel free to add your views and thoughts in the comments!
