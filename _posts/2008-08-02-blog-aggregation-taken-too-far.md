[This post](http://www.rtfm-ed.co.uk/?p=575) by Mike Laverick is, as I believe they say, spot on (did I get my British English right?). Blog aggregation is one thing; many bloggers do it, including myself in my Virtualization Short Takes. VMware does it with [Planet V12n](http://www.vmware.com/vmtn/planet/v12n/). It's not that uncommon. In my opinion, as long as the original blogger and the original blogger's website are properly and clearly attributed, it's not really a big deal.

The site that Mike [pointed out](http://vmware.dropcode.net), however, is---in my opinion---taking blog aggregation too far. There's no clear attribution of the original author nor a clear link back to the author's original site. I recognize content there from [RTFM Education](http://www.rtfm-ed.co.uk/) and [Yellow Bricks](http://www.yellow-bricks.com/) for sure, and I suspect that some of the other sites in the Blogroll are also being rolled in. At no point anywhere in any of the aggregated articles do I see a link back the original author, the original author's site, not even so much as mention of the original author's name. There is only a small byline that says "By: Other Website", but that's it.

If you want to aggregate content, feel free. Just be sure to give credit where credit is due, and don't rip off other people's content.
