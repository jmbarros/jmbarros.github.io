Andrew Kutz is on a roll. He's released [yet another plugin](http://www.lostcreations.com/code/wiki/vmware/viplugins/console) for the VMware Infrastructure Client; this latest plugin adds a "Console" tab when an ESX Server is selected that allows the user to open an SSH session to the selected server directly from the VMware Infrastructure client. No more need to launch PuTTY and log in!
