The time has come again for readers to vote for Eric Siebert's top 20 bloggers list. I've been honored to be placed at #2 for quite some time now, behind [Duncan Epping](http://www.yellow-bricks.com/) and ahead of [Chad Sakac](http://virtualgeek.typepad.com/virtual_geek/). In addition, some great new bloggers have arrived on the scene this past year, so the competition is going to be fierce. I hope to retain or improve my position, but I'm also realistic---there are some really _great_ bloggers out there.

In addition, my blogging frequency was down this past year because of the two books I wrote this year, [_Mastering VMware vSphere 4_](http://www.amazon.com/Mastering-VMware-vSphere-Computer-Tech/dp/0470481382/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1262660929&sr=1-1) and [_VMware vSphere 4 Administration Instant Reference_](http://www.amazon.com/VMware-vSphere-Administration-Instant-Reference/dp/0470520728/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1262660929&sr=1-2) (with Jase McCarty and Matthew Johnson).

Still, the site has a sizable following. I'm averaging around 7,700 RSS subscribers, and the site is getting around 100,000 visits a month (depending upon which statistics mechanism you use, sometimes higher and sometimes lower). Anecdotally, I've had a few other bloggers tell me that their traffic spikes whenever I link to one of their posts. I guess I must be doing something right!

Luckily, I have gotten a few good posts out this year:

[Creating a Bootable ESXi USB Stick on Mac OS X][1]  

[vSphere Virtual Machine Upgrade Process][2]  

[VMware vSphere vDS, VMkernel Ports, and Jumbo Frames][3]  

[New User's Guide to Configuring VMware ESX Networking via CLI][4]  

[Introduction to Nehalem Memory][5] (by guest author Aaron Delp)  

[Using VMware ESX Virtual Switch Tagging with HP Virtual Connect][6]  

[Another Reason Not to Use PVSCSI or VMXNET3][7]

And those are just the _virtualization-related_ posts...I've also expanded into more SAN-related posts (a couple of Cisco MDS posts [here][8] and [here][9]), an introductory post on SR-IOV [here][10], and some FCoE posts ([here][11] and [here][12], for example).

So, if you could find it in your hearts to vote for me, I'd certainly appreciate it. Go [vote](http://www.surveygizmo.com/s/222837/pick-your-top-10-favorite-blogs) now!
