Have you ever attended a technology conference and had your spouse go with you? More than likely, your spouse just sat around the hotel room, bored, waiting for you to get back after a long day of sessions and lectures and labs. Then, when you're tired and just want to relax, your spouse wants to go out on the town, explore, and see some cool stuff. Does that sound familiar?

Since 2008, my wife (Crystal, [@crystal_lowe](http://twitter.com/crystal_lowe) on Twitter) has organized a fix for this very problem, at least for one technology conference: VMworld spouse activities. Now back for a third year (see information for [2008 activities][1] and [2009 activities][2]), spouse activities---or Spousetivities as it's informally known---is bigger and better than ever. Backed by corporate sponsors, Crystal is now able to offer more planned excursions, free activities, and lots of goodies for attending spouses. To help streamline communications, she's even launched a spouse activities-focused website at [http://spousetivities.com](http://spousetivities.com/) and a dedicated Twitter account ([@Spousetivites](http://twitter.com/spousetivities)). If you aren't following either of these resources, you should be!

Here's a sneak peek of some of the great stuff that Crystal has planned for this year:

* Free Spousetivities T-shirt for the first 250 registered attendees (last year's shirts were _hilarious_--wait until you see this year!)

* Free welcome breakfast on Monday, August 30, for the first 150 registered attendees

* Discounted tours to the Wine Country, Muir Woods, and the San Francisco Bay islands

* A tour of privately-owned "trophy houseboats" in Sausalito

* A fabulous pre-VMworld couples activity that includes Monterey, Carmel, and Hearst Castle

These freebies and discounts are all due to the generous corporate sponsors who helped Crystal [make it happen](http://spousetivities.com/2010/05/making-it-happen/). If you're interested in registering, see [here](http://spousetivities.eventbrite.com/?discount=earlybirdspecial).

In addition to these organized activities, Crystal will be helping smaller groups self-organize for activities like shopping, sight-seeing, or exploring the city on your own.

As you can see, Crystal has put a ton of work into this year's activities. If you are planning on attending, you should definitely bring your spouse and get her (or him!) enrolled and registered.

Oh, and did I mention that she's planning activities for VMworld EMEA, too? That's right---for those of you that can't make it to San Francisco but will be in Copenhagen, Crystal is planning some activities there too. Keep your eyes open for more details on the EMEA activities.
