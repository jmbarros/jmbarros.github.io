My [dislike for the Remote CLI][1] is fairly well-known. Unfortunately, using the Remote CLI is the only way to perform a Storage VMotion. Storage VMotion is, of course, the new feature in ESX Server 3.5 that allows for a running VM's virtual disk files to be relocated from one datastore to a second datastore without any service interruption. A very handy feature, indeed, but hobbled---in my opinion---by its dependence upon the Remote CLI.

However, an enterprising developer has written a graphical front-end for the operation. Numerous sites have discussed it; for example, see [Eric Sloof's post](http://www.ntpro.nl/blog/archives/366-SVMotion-graphical-user-interface.html) or [Anders' post](http://www.amikkelsen.com/?p=58) (and the referenced [VMware Communities thread](http://communities.vmware.com/thread/122847?tstart=0)). I'm sure there have been numerous other sites as well.

Now, if a single developer could write a GUI for Storage VMotion, why didn't VMware take care of this themselves?
