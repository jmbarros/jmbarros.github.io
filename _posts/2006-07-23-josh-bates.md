It's a really good CD, actually, and I'm particularly enjoying a couple of the tracks. He's got a great voice, and the music and lyrics are good. So far, the title track ("Perfect Day") is a favorite of mine, and I'm also enjoying "Alive" and "You Say Come." "King of Glory" is another great song, and I believe that it's a hit single on the charts right now.

When you're feeling down, or feeling like you aren't quite "good enough", then the track "Less" will certainly speak to your heart, and remind you of the unfailing love of God.

Overall, I'd recommend the album; it's not too hard, but certainly not light listening either. Sorry, I'm not a professional music reviewer, so I can't really tell you any more than that. Give it a try and see.

([Josh's web site](http://www.joshbatesmusic.com/) isn't too bad, either, although I'm not a big fan of all-Flash sites.)
