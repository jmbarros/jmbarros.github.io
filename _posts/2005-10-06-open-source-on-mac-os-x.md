Most people automatically equate "open source" with Linux or [Apache](http://www.apache.org/). But there's more to open source than that. There are a wide variety of open source projects that are also targeted at (gasp) [Microsoft Windows](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/) and [Mac OS X](http://www.apple.com/macosx/).

Being a Mac user myself, I was particularly interested in [this article](http://software.newsforge.com/article.pl?sid=05/09/20/166254) recently posted at [NewsForge](http://www.newsforge.com/). Some of the projects listed there were new to me; for example, I had never heard of or used [Vienna](http://www.opencommunity.co.uk/vienna2.html). Given that I don't like brushed metal interfaces (can't stand them) and that I already use a commercial RSS reader, Vienna won't do me much good.

Many of the projects listed there, though, I was familiar with and actually using currently. For example, [Adium X](http://www.adiumx.com/) is my default IM client (I use it to stay connected to MSN, AIM, and Google Talk), [Cyberduck](http://cyberduck.ch/) is my FTP/SFTP client, and [Growl](http://growl.info/) helps keep me informed about what is happening with all the various applications I have running. I've never used [Seashore](http://seashore.sourceforge.net/), but I'll probably have a look at it soon (I've been looking for a good image editor).

[This link](http://www.nothickmanuals.info/doku.php?id=opensourcemac) (also referenced in the NewsForge article) lists an even larger variety of open source Mac applications. Again, some I recognize (and use), a lot that I don't. If you are a Mac user, I encourage you to take another look at some of the many high-quality open source projects available.
