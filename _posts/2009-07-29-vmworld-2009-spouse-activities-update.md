Last year, after attending VMworld with me for the previous two years, my wife Crystal ([@crystal_lowe](http://twitter.com/crystal_lowe) on Twitter) decided to organize [some activities for spouses][1] traveling to VMworld 2008. This year she's volunteered to do it again! If you're planning on bringing your spouse---or if you are a spouse traveling to San Francisco while your significant other will be attending VMworld 2009--you definitely want to look into joining Crystal for these activities!

Here's a brief rundown of what's planned so far:

* On _Tuesday, September 1, 2009,_ there will be an informal "Get To Know You" breakfast at Mel's Diner on 4th and Mission. This will start at 10AM.

* Following the "Get To Know You" breakfast, some ladies have expressed an interest in going to Korbel; others will be doing some sightseeing in San Francisco. Crystal is recommending spouses purchase the [San Francisco City Pass](http://www.citypass.com/city/sanfrancisco.html) for unlimited use of public transportation and admission to a number of area attractions.

* On _Wednesday, September 2, 2009,_ spouses will go tour Alcatraz together. **You must [purchase your Alcatraz tickets](https://www.alcatrazcruises.com/website/price-schedule-chart.aspx) in advance (they sell out early!).** After the Alcatraz tour will be shopping at Pier 39, a visit to the Aquarium by the Bay (free for City Pass holders), and possibly a 1 hour Bay Cruise (again, free for City Pass holders). That evening is the VMworld Party at 7PM; Crystal will be attending the party with me.

* On _Thursday, September 3, 2009,_ a group of spouses will be taking a Napa tour. She's arranged a group tour (more information [here](http://toursanfranciscobay.com/tours/redwoods-then-wine.html)), but must have a firm commitment to attend by **no later than Thursday, July 30, 2009** (yes, in two days). We are putting up our own personal funds to secure the group tour if enough people commit to attending. If we don't get enough firm commitments to secure that tour, spouses will need to individually purchase tickets for [this tour](http://www.napawinetours.net/tours/tourDetail.cfm?tour_id=7146) and specify the San Francisco Marriott as the pickup hotel.

* For spouses not interested in visiting Napa (or perhaps for spouses who have already visited Napa or will be visiting Napa with their husband/wife), some of the spouses will be doing more sightseeing in San Francisco on Thursday instead of doing the tour. Crystal will be sharing more information on available activities at the Get To Know You breakfast on Tuesday.

It's quite an ambitious schedule that Crystal has put together this year; I think she's outdone her schedule from last year!

If you are interested in participating in these activities, here's what you need to do:

* Drop Crystal an e-mail at [vmworldspouses@gmail.com](mailto:vmworldspouses@gmail.com). This is the e-mail account from which all communications will originate.

* If you use Twitter, follow [Crystal](http://twitter.com/crystal_lowe) (or [me](http://twitter.com/scott_lowe)).

* Subscribe to this blog, if you're not already subscribed. I'll be posting more information as VMworld 2009 draws closer. (Besides, this is a great site anyway, and you know you want to go ahead and subscribe.)

* Purchase your Alcatraz tour tickets in advance using the URL linked above. These tickets sell out, so you won't want to wait until the last minute.

* If you are interested in doing the Napa tour, give Crystal a firm commitment by **no later than Thursday, July 30, 2009**. An e-mail is fine.

If anyone has any questions, you're welcome to ask them in the comments to this posts, or you can just e-mail Crystal directly. Again, if you are interested in going on the Napa tour, we need a commitment by **no later than Thursday, July 30, 2009.**

Thanks for reading! I'm looking forward to seeing everyone in San Francisco.
