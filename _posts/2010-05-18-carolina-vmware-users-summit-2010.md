The third annual Carolina VMware Users Summit is fast approaching, and this year looks awesome! Joining [Mike Laverick](http://www.rtfm-ed.co.uk/)---who is attending the event for the third year in a row---is NetApp's Vaughn Stewart. Both [Chad Sakac](http://virtualgeek.typepad.com/) and I, both with EMC Corporation, are also going to be there.

The current conference agenda is available on the [Charlotte VMUG Regional User Conference home page](http://info.vmware.com/content/VMUG_Conference_Agenda?ug=cha). You can also register for the event there.

If you are anywhere near the Charlotte, NC area on Friday, June 11, 2010, I highly encourage you to make the time to stop by the event. You won't be disappointed!
