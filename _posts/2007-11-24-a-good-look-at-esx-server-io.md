[This article](http://blogs.netapp.com/storage_nuts_n_bolts/2007/11/a-look-at-the-e.html) showed up in my RSS feeds; it's a fairly in-depth look at the ESX Server I/O stack, written by Nick Triantos. Nick is with [Network Appliance](http://www.netapp.com/); I believe in their Global Services division. I've bookmarked it for a more comprehensive review later, when I can really dedicate myself to the information he's sharing here.

As an aside, Nick's blog recently moved; he used to be [here](http://storagefoo.blogspot.com/), but now can be found [here](http://blogs.netapp.com/storage_nuts_n_bolts/) instead.

Great information---thanks, Nick!
