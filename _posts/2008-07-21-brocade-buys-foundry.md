A colleague at work just turned me on to the news that [Brocade will be buying Foundry](http://www.crn.com/networking/209400238) for $3 billion. This sets the stage for Brocade to compete even more directly with Cisco, not only in storage networking but now also in Ethernet networking.

Thanks for the heads-up, Greg!
