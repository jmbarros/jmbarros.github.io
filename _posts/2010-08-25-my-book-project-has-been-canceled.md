Over the last couple months I've been working on a revision to _Mastering VMware vSphere 4_ that incorporated new content for the VMware vSphere 4.1 release. Unfortunately, due to production timelines and some other constraints, Sybex has decided not to proceed with this revision. Bummer! I understand the publisher's reasons for not proceeding with the project, but it is a shame nevertheless.

I like to try to stay positive, though, so here are some upsides:

* I have more time to spend with my family. That's **always** a good thing!

* I have more time to work on my professional certifications, which had taken a back seat to the writing.

* I have more time to blog, which (hopefully) you agree is a good thing too!

However, with the closing of that door, who knows what other doors might open?
