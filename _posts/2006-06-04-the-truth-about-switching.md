While browsing [digg.com](http://digg.com/), I came across this article regarding the [truth about switching to the Mac](http://utilware.com/switching.html). It's pretty accurate, too, both on the good points as well as the bad points (and yes, there are a few bad points).

I can echo some of the author's comments:

* It's true that some people will "look down" on you for owning a Mac. For the most part, your professional peers won't really care one way or the other, but there are those occasions where people will make the comments like, "Whoa! Watch out, he's using out a Mac!" The comments are made in a light tone, but there is an underlying hint of seriousness that gives it away. I think that some of it is a lack of knowledge (see next point).

* Using a Mac will cause people to ask questions, and talk to you about your Mac. On more than one occasion, I've had people ask me why I use a Mac, or what it is about [Mac OS X](http://www.apple.com/macosx/) that makes it so different from Windows, or if it's true that Mac OS X is more secure than Windows.

* I have to disagree about regretting the purchase when you switch; I switched almost three years ago and haven't really looked back since then.

All in all, it's a pretty good article, and it was particularly refreshing to see someone willing to point out the good things _and_ the bad things about being a Mac switcher. I encourage you to read the [whole article](http://utilware.com/switching.html).
