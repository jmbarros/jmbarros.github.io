I just wanted to provide a quick update on some articles I have in the works to be (hopefully) published soon.

* I'm working on an article discussing when to use various NIC teaming configurations with VMware ESX. There are some significant repercussions here for a variety of network configurations, but especially so for configurations involving IP-based storage (iSCSI or NFS).

* I'm finally wrapping up an article on the Xsigo I/O Director. I've been working a Xsigo VP780 in the lab for quite some time, and this article will provide a brief overview along with some tips and tricks.

* I received word from HP that I should be getting a ProCurve switch in my lab soon, so that means I can provide a ProCurve-oriented version of this [NIC teaming and VLAN trunking article][1].

* I have some notes on using NetApp Open Systems SnapVault (OSSV) in conjunction with VMware ESX that I plan to post here as well.

New versions of the Linux and Solaris AD integration articles are on the way as well, starting with an update of the Solaris instructions to accommodate Solaris 10 Update 5 and Windows Server 2008.

If there's anything else you're interested in seeing, let me know in the comments. Thanks for reading!

**UPDATE:** The NIC utilization article is available [here][2].
