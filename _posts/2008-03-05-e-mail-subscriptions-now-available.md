RSS is handy, but not everyone likes RSS. Some people prefer to receive updates about this site via e-mail, and to help accommodate that I've enabled e-mail subscriptions to the site. To subscribe to receive updates about this weblog via e-mail, just follow these simple instructions:

1. From your web browser, open the [feed URL](http://feeds.scottlowe.org/slowe/content/feed) for the site. I've hyperlinked it for your convenience.

2. An HTML interpretation of the RSS feed will be displayed. In the upper right hand corner, there will be a box titled "Subscribe Now!" In that box, there's a hyperlink labeled "Get blog.scottlowe.org delivered by email". Click that link.

3. The next screen will prompt you to enter your e-mail address and enter a verification code that is displayed on the screen. Provide that information and then click the button labeled "Complete Subscription Request."

4. Soon thereafter, you'll receive an e-mail in your Inbox. In that e-mail will be a link---which you should _NOT_ click on, but should instead copy and paste into your browser---to complete and verify the subscription.

That's it, you're all set! Please note that the "Reply-To" address on the e-mails you receive from the site is not valid, so don't be surprised if you reply to a message and get a non-delivery report back. If you need to contact me via e-mail, my information is available here on the site.

Thanks to everyone for reading, and I hope that this new service will be helpful to some of you!
