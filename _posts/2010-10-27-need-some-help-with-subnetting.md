Having recently re-certified as CCNA, I can definitely attest that subnetting is something you must master if you want to achieve a Cisco certification. Rightfully so; mastering subnetting is critical to being an effective network administrator, in my opinion.

I recently came across a series of articles designed to help improve people's subnetting skills. If you are struggling with subnetting, I'd encourage you to have a look at these articles (and the comments) for some useful tips and tricks.
