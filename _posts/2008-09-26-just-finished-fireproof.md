My wife, a couple of the kids, and I just got back home after watching _Fireproof_ at the local movie theater. You'll recall that I first mentioned Fireproof [back in August][1], and today was the opening day. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. If you haven't seen it, make plans to go see it right away! The movie is great, but the Message in the movie is even greater.
