It's finally time! I'm very excited to announce the details of the book I've been working on for the last couple of months: _Mastering VMware vSphere 4.0_, by Sybex (an imprint of Wiley Publishing).

_Mastering VMware vSphere 4.0_ tackles every major technology area within vSphere---including installation of ESX/ESXi and vCenter Server, vCenter Update Manager, vSphere's new storage architecture and capabilities, vSphere's new networking functionality (like the vNetwork Distributed Switch and the Cisco Nexus 1000V). It's all in there! At least, we've tried our best to make sure it's all in there!

_Mastering VMware vSphere 4.0_ should be available for pre-order later this summer and will be on the shelves by late September. We really, really, **really** tried to have it ready before VMworld 2009 in late August/early September, but the production schedule was just too aggressive to ensure a quality work.

I know it's still early yet, but I do want to go ahead and publicly thank those that have been working with me. To [Rick](http://vmwaretips.com/wp/), Agatha, Jennifer, and [Chad](http://virtualgeek.typepad.com/): a huge **thank you** for all your help. This book wouldn't be what it is without your help.

As soon as I have a link to the book on Amazon or any other online resellers I'll be sure to post something here. I'm also working with the publisher on some promotional campaigns, so be sure to stay tuned for more information on that. And spread the word, please! Tell everyone you know who's interested in virtualization about this book.
