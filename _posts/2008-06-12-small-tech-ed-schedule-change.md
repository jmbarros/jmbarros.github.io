One quick note to readers following my Tech-Ed 2008 coverage: I'm making a small schedule change for today. I'll be skipping the morning sessions except for VIR358 and spending some time in the Partner Expo area instead. Look for an update on some of the discussions from the Partner Expo late tomorrow.
