This is really exciting news. Development on [Cocoalicious](http://www.scifihifi.com/cocoalicious/), the [Mac OS X](http://www.apple.com/macosx/) native application that front-ends [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us/), has [started back up again](http://alittledrop.com/2007/04/13/cocoalicious-10b44/).

I've blogged many times about Cocoalicious (starting as far back as June of 2005) and how much I enjoy using the application to manage [my del.icio.us bookmarks](http://del.icio.us/slowe/). I was really disappointed that development had stalled, and had even started [searching for replacements][1] to the application. Fortunately, it looks like the new developer (who is working with the original author, not replacing him, from what I understand) is already seeking feedback and ideas for future versions.

Personally, I'm pretty thrilled with the application as it is, and have only _one_ feature request: please, please, _PLEASE_ drop the brushed metal interface. Or at least offer us an option to toggle back and forth. I'd love to see a fresh new UI like that used by [Mail.app](http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/mail/) or [NetNewsWire](http://www.newsgator.com/NGOLProduct.aspx?ProdID=NetNewsWire), with the tags in a pane on the left and your bookmarks listed on the right, and a divider (like the one used now) to open, close, or resize the built-in browser. Combine that with a new, modern unified toolbar (not Mail.app's lozenges, please!) and perhaps incorporate some of the tag UIs that have been proposed (like [this one](http://www.tumultco.com/blog/?p=43)), and you've got yourself one killer del.icio.us client.
