There's good news on the book front. My book, _Mastering VMware vSphere 4_, is into the production phase. All the writing is complete, edits are complete or very nearly complete, and things are winding down. It's been a crazy road, but one that I'm glad I took. So what's the good news? **The book will be available at VMworld!**

Yes, that's right---you'll be able to buy _Mastering VMware vSphere 4_ at VMworld 2009 in San Francisco at the conference bookstore. I'm sure that also means there will be a book signing (by yours truly, of course!), although the details for that have not yet been determined.

But that's not all, I have more good news! If you can't wait until VMworld to order your copy, you can pre-order your copy via [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Mastering-Vmware-Infrastructure-Scott-Lowe/dp/0470481382/ref=sr_1_3/189-1468669-0910930?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1241107850&sr=1-3), [Barnes & Noble](http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Mastering-VMware-vSphere-4/Scott-Lowe/e/9780470481387/?itm=3), and [Borders](http://www.borders.com/online/store/TitleDetail?sku=0470481382). In addition, if you use the code **D3A7V3V** you should be able to get 20% of the book at Barnes & Noble. I had an online coupon for Borders, too, but it expired. Sorry.

So, if you haven't already pre-ordered your copy, feel free to use one of the links above, or you can wait and pick up your copy in San Francisco at the VMworld 2009 conference bookstore.
