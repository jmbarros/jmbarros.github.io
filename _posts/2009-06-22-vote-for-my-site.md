Last week, Eric Siebert issued a call for the community to [vote on the top 5 VMware blogs](http://vsphere-land.com/news/heres-your-chance-to-pick-the-top-vmware-blogs.html). If you haven't already voted in Eric's [survey](https://vsphere-land.justsurvey.me/506ca756773), please go over now and be sure to cast a vote to keep me in the top 5 of Eric's list.

Of course, I'd love to have you vote me into the #1 position, but if you'd prefer to put Duncan ([Yellow Bricks](http://www.yellow-bricks.com/)) or Chad ([Virtual Geek](http://virtualgeek.typepad.com/)) there I completely understand. (It's hard to compete with solid technical content like theirs!) Either way, be sure to vote and I'd appreciate your support!
