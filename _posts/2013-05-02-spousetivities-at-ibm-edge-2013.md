Regular readers of this site know that my wife, Crystal, runs something called [Spousetivities](http://spousetivities.com). Spousetivities originated out of boredom, essentially---Crystal was traveling with me to VMworld and wanted to find someone to hang out with while I was at the conference. That was VMworld 2008, and since that time she's had activities at [VMworld 2009][1], [VMworld 2010][2] (including [VMworld Europe 2010][3]), VMworld 2011 (both [US][4] and [Europe][5]), and [VMworld 2012][6] (US and Europe). She's also had activities at EMC World (2011 and 2012), [HP Discover EMEA][7], and Dell Storage Forum in Boston. This year, she's added another conference: IBM Edge 2013 in Las Vegas!

IBM Edge 2013 (conference site [here](http://www-03.ibm.com/systems/edge/)) runs from June 10-14 at Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas. If you are attending IBM Edge 2013 this year, I'd encourage you to consider bringing your spouse or significant other with you and getting them involved in Spousetivities. As is always the case, Crystal has a great line-up of activities planned for participants, including:

* The ever-popular "Getting to Know You" breakfast on Monday, June 10

* A "Culinary Mystery Tour" of famous restaurants along the Strip

* A tour of Red Rock Canyon Conservation area and highlights of the famous Vegas strip

* "Cooking at the Ranch," where you'll get to meet Chef Philip Dell of Sin City Chefs and the Food Network's show "Chopped" (More details [here](http://spousetivities.com/2013/04/celebrity-chef-ibm-edge-and-spousetivities/).)

* A Grand Canyon tour

* A Hoover Dam tour

* A wide variety of spa services from THE Bathhouse, including facials, manicures, massages, and pedicures

All in all, it looks like a great week of activities. For the conference attendee, you gain the benefit of being able to spend time with your partner in the evenings without having to worry about them during the day (leaving you to be able to focus on the conference). For the partner traveling with the attendee, you don't have to worry about being alone, finding your way around town, or bothering your partner at the conference. It is truly a "win-win" for everyone involved.

All these activities have been discounted, thanks to IBM's sponsorship of Spousetivities, so I encourage you to visit [the registration page](http://edge2013-spousetivities.eventbrite.com) and get signed up as soon as possible.
