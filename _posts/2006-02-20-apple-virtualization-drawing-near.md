Remember me pining for [virtualization on Apple's new Intel-based Macs][1]? That day has drawn much, much closer with the release of Universal binaries of [Q](http://www.kberg.ch/q/index.php), a [Mac OS X](http://www.apple.com/macosx/) port of [QEMU](http://www.qemu.org/).

It's still an unstable build, but with Universal binaries available for Q, we now have the option of running x86 operating systems on an x86-based Apple with Mac OS X as the host. Sweet! This will probably be one of the very first things I try once I get my hands on a new [MacBook Pro](http://www.apple.com/macbookpro/); unfortunately, my budget being what it is (i.e., too limited for a new MacBook Pro right now), that will have to wait. But that's OK, as it will give the excellent Q project more time to mature and develop.
