Day 3 of our road trip to Colorado completes our trip and puts us in Denver. The trip today was pretty straightforward. We left Kansas City this morning and just followed I-70 across Kansas into Colorado. When it was all said and done, it took about 9 hours of driving to go from Kansas City to Denver.

Now that we've arrived in Denver, we're in a hotel for the next few days until our house in Castle Pines North is ready for us to move in. In the meantime, I'll be handling all the various move-related issues that need to be addressed---change of address forms, insurance, driver's licenses, etc. That also includes buying some furniture, a task we got started on tonight with a quick trip to the new Ikea store here in Denver.

I have a couple of blog posts in the works that I'll try to get published over the next few days, but with all the move-related tasks that need to be handled I'm not sure I'll actually be able to get them finished and posted. I'll do my best!
