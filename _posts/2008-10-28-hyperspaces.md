I have long had a "love/hate" relationship with virtual desktops on Mac OS X. In late 2005, I discovered Desktop Manager, a then-great application to provide virtual desktops. In early 2006, I switched to Virtue (later to become VirtueDesktops) and continued to use that up until I purchased my MacBook Pro in late 2006. At that time, VirtueDesktops was having a bit of a challenge making the transition to a Universal binary, so I settled for using Exposé instead of virtual desktops.

VirtueDesktops ceased development due to the introduction of Spaces in Leopard, but the developer---Tony Arnold---later unveiled that he would create an application to enhance Leopard's Spaces. That application, [Hyperspaces](http://hyperspacesapp.com/), is now available as a public preview.

I had high hopes for Hyperspaces, having worked extensively with VirtueDesktops. I was disappointed. I suppose I shouldn't have expected so much, given that this is a preview of the 1.0 release. I had been hoping for a bezel pop-up similar to Quicksilver and VirtueDesktops, but instead we have a menu item and an attached pager. There's no moving windows between desktops without reverting to the standard Spaces interface, and none of the very cool special effects that graced VirtueDesktops---like the cube effect---are present.

I strongly imagine that Tony will greatly enhance and expand the functionality of Hyperspaces over time. Until then, I'll stick to Exposé.
