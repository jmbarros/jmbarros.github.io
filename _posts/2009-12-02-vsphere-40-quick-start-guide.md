It's funny how ideas evolve. Months ago, the idea of a "super blog" came up in a series of Twitter conversations. Stephen Foskett ([@sfoskett](http://twitter.com/sfoskett) on Twitter) ran with that idea to create [Gestalt IT](http://gestaltit.com/); Duncan Epping ([@DuncanYB](http://twitter.com/duncanyb) on Twitter) ran with that idea to create _vSphere 4.0 Quick Start Guide: Shortcuts down the path of Virtualization_.

I didn't, unfortunately, get a chance to actually have a look at the QSG (easier to type than "Quick Start Guide") until this past week. Some preview copies were given away at VMworld 2009 in San Francisco, but I didn't manage to get a copy. After having some time to review it briefly this past week---I still haven't read the entire book cover-to-cover---I must say that I am impressed.

What I've seen of the book is thorough, detailed, and takes a "common sense" approach to providing how-to information on VMware vSphere. In this respect, it's a lot like my second book, _VMware vSphere 4 Administration Instant Reference_, which I co-wrote with Jase McCarty and Matthew Johnson and which will be officially released later this month (pre-orders available on Amazon right now). One thing that I do like about the QSG is the integration of PowerCLI at every stage. This makes it super-easy for aspiring PowerCLI gurus to learn their way around the cmdlets and how to put them together. It's an idea I wish I'd thought of doing! Overall, given the breadth of coverage and the detail provided, the QSG does a great job.

If you're looking for a how-to guide on VMware vSphere, buy both my book and the QSG for the most extensive coverage. Both books---mine or the QSG---provide excellent coverage on their own; the QSG certainly excels in the practical application of PowerCLI to the administration tasks. Either would be a great choice. To Duncan, Thomas, Dave, Stuart, Alan, and Bernie: **great work, guys!**
