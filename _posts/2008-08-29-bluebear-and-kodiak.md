I guess I'm a little behind the times here, but a little company named [Bluebear](http://www.bluebearllc.net/) is in the process of developing a cutting-edge cross-hypervisor management tool named [Kodiak](http://www.bluebearllc.net/kodiak/).

Kodiak is in private beta right now, so we can't test it ourselves to see what it looks like. Based on the screenshots available on the website, and through what I've seen in talking with one of the developers in the #vmware channel on IRC, it's pretty awesome. And the best feature? **_It's cross-platform!_** Written in Adobe AIR, it runs on Windows, Linux, and (my personal favorite) Mac OS X. In addition to being cross-platform, it's also intended to be hypervisor-neutral, managing VMware, Xen, and Hyper-V. Only VMware support is present right now, but support for the others is coming.

If Kodiak ends up being as good as it looks like it will be, this will be awesome tool. As a VM admin, you'll want to stay on top of the development of this tool.
