Here I thought I was getting a scoop, but it appears that the e-mail I received regarding the [Storage VMotion plugin for VirtualCenter 2.5](http://www.lostcreations.com/code/wiki/vmware/viplugins/svmotion) was distributed to a few others as well.

This new plugin goes above and beyond the previous [GUI for Storage VMotion][1] by integrating directly into VirtualCenter. While not fully tested, it is expected to be fully functional, and [this VMware Communities thread](http://communities.vmware.com/thread/126141) seems to indicate that it's working reasonably well for users thus far.

Kudos to Schley Andrew Kutz for his work on creating this plugin.
