I'm a bit behind the times on this one, as I know that several other bloggers have already made the announcement about the HyTrust Appliance Community Edition. This is a free version of the HyTrust Appliance that supports up to 3 ESX hosts and provides centralized access management and audit logging.

In any case, if you want more information on the HyTrust Appliance Community Edition, go have a look [here at the HyTrust web site](http://www.hytrust.com/community). If you are so inclined, you can get the full press release [here](http://www.hytrust.com/downloads/releases/press-release-20090505-community-edition.pdf).
