This [article on application delivery](http://www.brianmadden.com/content/content.asp?id=566) (written by Brian Madden) got me thinking about synergies between technologies. The article was intended to be a discussion about the various technologies and architectures for delivering applications to users, but what struck me more was the idea of complementary technologies offering more together than they could individually.

In this particular instance, the article mentions a couple of technologies that can create some real synergies when used together. For example, the article mentions "application streaming," via a product such as what [Softricity](http://www.softricity.com/) offers. It looks to be a very nice product (I have no personal experience), but could it be better when used with another technology? What about combining it with [Citrix](http://www.citrix.com/), as is mentioned in the article? In that case, you have Softricity streaming the application to the Citrix server, the Citrix server performing the execution and sending the display down to the client. The advantage? Easier management of applications into servers running Citrix Presentation Server, as well as isolation of applications on the Citrix servers. In this case, each product involved---Citrix Presentation Server and Softricity SoftGrid---are very good products, but used together we get more than we would have individually. (Again, this idea is not mine, it was mentioned in the linked article above.)

So what other kinds of synergies can we identify? Is it worthwhile to try to identify these synergies? Very much so, in my opinion. If we, as IT professionals, can identify where specific technologies or products can be combined together to create something that is more than just the sum of the components, then we've managed to add real value for our customers.

I'm going to make it a point over the next few weeks to actively seek out these synergies, to try to find new ways of combining products, services, and technologies. If you have any ideas you'd like to share with me, feel free to e-mail me or leave a comment.
