I'd like to take this time and wish everyone a very Happy New Year! I hope that the Lord has blessed you this past year, and I hope that He will continue to bless you in the new year.

"Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you." (Matthew 6:33 KJV)
