With the recent downturn in the economy, it seems like companies on all sides are running into lots of problems. This seems to be particularly true; I've heard rumors---nothing confirmed, mind you---that more than one virtualization-related startup is down to a skeleton crew in the hopes they can survive the economic storm.

That does not appear to be the case with [Hyper9](http://www.hyper9.com/), who recently announced two pieces of good news. First, the company has just closed an $8 million Series B round of funding. Second, they've announced that Mike Maples Sr. has joined the Board of Directors. Apparently this second announcement is quite significant, although I must admit the significance is mostly lost on me (I'm not really familiar with Mr. Maples' business history). David Marshall, who works for Hyper9, also covered this news [on his blog](http://vmblog.com/archive/2009/02/26/venrock-leads-investment-round-in-hyper9-mike-maples-sr-joins-its-board-of-directors.aspx) as well.

In any case, it's nice to see that at least a few companies are doing well. To David Marshall and crew at Hyper9, here's a good luck wish to you! If you keep up the good work on the Hyper9 products, I'm confident you'll do well.
