It's been a couple of months since I posted my last collection of UCS-related posts. Since that time, I've collected a few more posts, so here's another collection of UCS posts (in no particular order).

[The State of Statelessness: Cisco UCS vs. HP Virtual Connect](http://www.mseanmcgee.com/2010/04/the-state-of-statelessness-cisco-ucs-vs-hp-virtual-connect/)  

[Gestalt IT Tech Field Day  On Cisco and UCS](http://basraayman.com/2010/04/14/gestalt-it-tech-field-day-on-cisco-and-ucs/)  

[How Cisco UCS Deals with Split Brains](http://blog.aarondelp.com/2010/02/how-cisco-ucs-deals-with-split-brains.html)  

[L2 Forwarding Rules in UCS EHV Mode](http://www.unifiedcomputingblog.com/?p=83)  

[Scalability Study for Deploying VMware View on Cisco UCS and EMC Symmetrix V-Max Systems](http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/solutions/Enterprise/Data_Center/App_Networking/vdiucswp.html)  

[Cisco C200M1 CIMC Update Process](http://flickerdown.com/2010/03/cisco-c200m1-cimc-update-process/)

As I uncover more UCS posts, I'll bring them to your attention here. If you have some useful UCS information or useful UCS posts, please feel free to add them to the comments below (with full vendor disclosure, please). Thanks!
