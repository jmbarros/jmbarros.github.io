From an e-mail I received regarding the announcement:

>This morning Microsoft announced their intent to purchase Kidaro, a leading provider of desktop virtualization solutions for enterprises.
>
>This is a significant announcement for both Microsoft and Kidaro with the potential to enable valuable new scenarios for customers leveraging the virtualization capabilities in the Microsoft Desktop Optimization Pack.  The acquisition will allow Kidaro's desktop virtualization technology to be added to the Microsoft Desktop Optimization Pack Microsoft (MDOP), allowing IT professionals to optimize their desktop infrastructure by providing management capabilities for Virtual PCs, streamlining OS deployments, and easing application compatibility issues. This is a key step in Microsoft's strategy for delivering Dynamic IT virtualization capabilities from the desktop to the data center.
