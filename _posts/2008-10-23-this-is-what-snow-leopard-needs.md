Before the release of Mac OS X 10.5 "Leopard," the computing world was abuzz with the possible inclusion of ZFS---Zettabyte File System---into the new operating system. That rumor was largely fueled by the rumors swirling around about what would officially become known as Time Machine. It turns out that ZFS _did_ make its way into Leopard, albeit on a read-only basis, and it isn't the technology behind Time Machine.

Now, the next version of Mac OS X, version 10.6 code-named "Snow Leopard," is said to be more evolutionary than revolutionary. Personally, I'd love to see Apple fully embrace ZFS as its file system of choice, and then throw away the goofy "flying through space" UI in Time Machine to embrace [something like this](http://blogs.sun.com/erwann/entry/zfs_on_the_desktop_zfs). Of course, Apple can seriously turn up the UI polish, but this kind of approach makes sense and seems relatively easy to incorporate into the Finder interface.

So what do you think? Am I way out in left field here, or does anyone else think this seems like a good idea?
