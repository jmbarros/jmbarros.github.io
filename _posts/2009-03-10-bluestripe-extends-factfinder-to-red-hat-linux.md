[BlueStripe Software](http://bluestripe.com/), a company I've written about a couple of times and who is based in the Raleigh-Durham, NC, area, is launching FactFinder 2.0. I discussed the previous version, FactFinder 1.1, [here][1]; and have talked with the guys from BlueStripe on a number of occasions, including [at VMworld 2008][2]. I try not to just post press releases or other news information without also adding a little bit of extra information, analysis, or my own thoughts. I have seen FactFinder in action, and it does represent a different way of approaching performance and availability issues. It's not necessarily a _unique_ way, though, as there are other companies that also work from the application level. I'm confident they don't use the same technology, but they are working from the application level.

One of the major new features in this new release of FactFinder is support for Red Hat Enterprise Linux, which allows FactFinder to bring the same application discovery and service-level awareness now to the Linux platform. Of course, FactFinder fully supports both physical and virtualized instances of both Windows and now Linux, and in fact describes their product as a great way to ensure successful P2V (physical-to-virtual) conversions---not just from a "Did the conversion work?" perspective, but more importantly from the perspective of, "Does the application still perform at the required levels?" It's the applications people care about, after all.

The full press release is [here](http://bluestripe.com/blog/bluestripe-news/2009/03/10/3102009-bluestripe-software-launches-factfinder-20-delivering-its-award-winning-asm-solution-to-red-hat-enterprise-linux/).
