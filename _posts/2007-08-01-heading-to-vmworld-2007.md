I just got the news today that I'm heading to [VMworld 2007](http://www.vmware.com/vmworld/) in September! It's going to be a fantastic trip---I haven't been to San Francisco in years, and I'm looking forward to VMworld, the keynotes, the announcements, and the in-depth technical sessions. Drop me a line and let me know if you're going, and perhaps I'll see you there!
