Time is running out! As most of you already know, I---along with [Chad Sakac](http://virtualgeek.typepad.com/), [Duncan Epping](http://www.yellow-bricks.com/), [Tom Howarth](http://planetvm.net/blog/), and [Rick Scherer](http://vmwaretips.com/wp/)--will be speaking at VMworld 2009 at TA2259, Ask the Experts.

One of things we wanted to do was to poll the VMware community ahead of time for questions that you wanted to include as part of the discussion, in addition to the questions raised by the audience. If you have a question you'd like to submit, time is running out! We need you to visit one of our sites and submit a question. The link for question submission on my site is [here][1].

Don't just sit there---click the link and go submit a question!
