If you've been reading my blog for any reasonable length of time, you already know that I value the Mac OS X-only utility [Quicksilver](http://blacktree.com/). It took me some time to get accustomed to it, but I quickly found it indispensable. Since that time, I've been staying alert for new plugins that will help make my life easier.

So imagine my delight last night when I came across this [SSH plugin](http://boinkor.net/archives/2006/11/hacking_objective_c_for_fun_an.html) for Quicksilver (updated version available [here](http://boinkor.net/archives/2006/11/more_quicksilverification.html)). The plugin allows you to make SSH connections to remote hosts, cataloging the known_hosts file along the way to make it easier. Since I use SSH a lot---it seems like I'm constantly opening an SSH session up to a Linux, Solaris, or ESX Server machine---this plugin is tremendously helpful. If you use SSH and Quicksilver, I highly recommend this plugin.
