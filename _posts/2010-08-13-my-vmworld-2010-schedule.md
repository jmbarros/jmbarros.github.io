So...are there any really good sessions that I've missed? I'm trying to increase my focus on security (especially as relates to service providers) and desktop virtualization, so I'm open to suggestions for other sessions I should consider instead of the ones I have listed.

If you are attending VMworld 2010 and are interested in getting together with me, I'd love to meet up with you (schedule permitting, of course!). My conference calendar is available [here](http://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=1207jmo0o6amjpre1b2db6jscg%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America/Los_Angeles); feel free to have a look and propose a potential meeting time.

And while we are discussing schedules and calendars, I would be remiss if I didn't take this opportunity to remind you to visit [the Spousetivites home page](http://spousetivities.com/) and register for spouse activities. You **_are_** bringing your spouse, right? Of course you are!

See you in San Francisco!
