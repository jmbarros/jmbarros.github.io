David Davis of Train Signal recently dropped me an e-mail to alert me to the release of a new series of videos titled [VMware vSphere Troubleshooting Training](http://www.trainsignal.com/VMware-vSphere-Troubleshooting-Training.aspx). Having watched a fair number of the Train Signal videos---I used them while prepping for my CCNA exam late last year and have watched many of the vSphere videos---I'm confident in saying that this will be a valuable resource for anyone who is interested in learning more about vSphere and how to troubleshoot vSphere. This is especially true for users who are new to vSphere. (I know it's hard to believe that some users are new to vSphere, especially for the long-time users, but it is very true.)

However, even for users who are a bit more experienced with vSphere, David structured this troubleshooting course around the VMware Certified Advanced Professional Data Center Administration (VCAP-DCA) blueprint and this course will be part of an upcoming VCAP-DCA training package. So, those of you who are out there prepping for VCAP-DCA---keeping in mind that VCAP-DCA is a necessary first step on the path toward VCDX---might be interested in this training course as well.

A snippet of one of the troubleshooting videos [is available online](http://www.vmwarevideos.com/vsphere-troubleshooting-video-how-to-restore-network-vmware-esxi) in the event you'd like to take a look.
