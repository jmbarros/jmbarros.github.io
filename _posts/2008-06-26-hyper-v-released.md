Today Microsoft released Hyper-V 1.0, their bare-metal hypervisor. I haven't been able to find much information on the Internet about it yet other than [Alessandro's announcement](http://www.virtualization.info/2008/06/release-microsoft-hyper-v-10.html) and [this article at Network World](http://www.networkworld.com/news/2008/062608-microsoft-ships-hyperv.html?nlhtmn=ts_062608&nladname=062608microsoftal); there was nothing on the Microsoft web site about it at the time of this writing.

I've covered Hyper-V extensively in the last few weeks due to my Tech-Ed coverage, so I'll refer readers back to some of the Hyper-V related sessions for more information on Hyper-V architecture, networking, security, or storage:

[VIR367: Hyper-V Security and Best Practices][1]  

[VIR250: Advanced Storage Connectivity for VMs][2]  

[VIR358: Hyper-V Architecture, Scenarios, and Networking][3]  

[Significant Networking Problem with Hyper-V][4]  

[Hyper-V Clustering Scenarios][5]  

[More on Hyper-V and NIC Teaming][6]

The release of Hyper-V now opens the door for Microsoft's System Center team to finalize Virtual Machine Manager 2008, which I currently see as a notable competitive advantage over VMware due to VMM's ability to manage both Hyper-V as well as VI3. There are a number of VMM 2008 posts available with more information also:

[VIR253: Microsoft System Center VMM 2008, Part 1 of 2][7]  

[VIR360: Microsoft System Center VMM 2008, Part 2 of 2][8]  

[VIR350: System Center VMM Advanced Integration][9]

The next few weeks will be interesting to watch; in particular, I'm interested to see what actions VMware will take to counter this new competitive threat.

**UPDATE:** Microsoft finally provided some URLs to their announcements:
