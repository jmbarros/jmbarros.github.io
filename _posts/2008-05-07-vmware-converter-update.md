Via [Eric Sloof](http://www.ntpro.nl/blog/archives/460-VMware-Converter-3.0.3.html), I learned that VMware has released a minor update to VMware Converter, bringing it up to version 3.0.3.

This updates bring a number of fixes and some new features. One of the most notable new features is support for the creation of Open Virtual Machine Format (OVF) version 0.9. This means that you can create a VM in VMware Infrastructure, then use VMware Converter to export it into an OVF virtual appliance bundle for distribution. This might be distribution to other organizations or individuals, or it might simply be distribution to a different location within your organization.

For more details, have a look at the [release notes](http://www.vmware.com/support/converter/doc/releasenotes_conv303.html) for this latest update.
