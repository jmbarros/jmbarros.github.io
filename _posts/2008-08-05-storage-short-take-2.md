Here's another installation of Storage Short Takes, with news and views of the storage world. Readers, if you have any more sources of information about storage happenings, please let me know in the comments. I'd love to expand the coverage of storage in these posts.

* I came across this [EMC CLARiiON-focused blog](http://clariionblogs.blogspot.com/) the other day. Although it hasn't been updated since March of this year and the volume of posts is quite low, the quality of the posts seems pretty good. (I'm new to EMC storage, though, so what this guy is saying might be way off and I'd never know.) The blog post about [LUN alignment plus VMDK alignment](http://clariionblogs.blogspot.com/2008/03/setting-alignment-offset-on-esx-server.html) was particularly helpful.

* Stephen Foskett has a good overview of [just the storage-related fixes and enhancements](http://blog.fosketts.net/2008/07/28/storage-fixes-in-vmware-esx-server-35-update-2/) found in Update 2 of VMware Infrastructure 3 version 3.5.

* EMC recently introduced the CLARiiON CX4 series of storage arrays (more information [here](http://www.emc.com/about/news/press/2008/20080805-01.htm)), and Chad Sakac [blogged about it](http://virtualgeek.typepad.com/virtual_geek/2008/08/our-vmware-cent.html) in relation to VMware and other virtualization technologies. Looks pretty impressive; I may have to take Chad up on his offer of hardware for the lab...

* NetApp has [apparently released](http://www.pkguild.com/?p=124) Data ONTAP 7.3. Check [NOW](http://now.netapp.com) for more details on the specific features added in this release.

Thanks for reading!

**UPDATE:** I had a typo in the URL for the NOW site above; that has been corrected. Thanks, Jeremiah!
