[SearchVMware.com](http://searchvmware.techtarget.com/) has published my latest VDI article, a closer look at the [integration of the connection broker with VirtualCenter](http://searchvmware.techtarget.com/tip/0,289483,sid179_gci1286004,00.html):

>In my last article on virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI), I discussed the [three main components of a VDI solution](http://searchvmware.techtarget.com/tip/0,289483,sid179_gci1280569,00.html?bucket=ETA&topic=308146): the virtualization servers and supporting infrastructure, the hosted operating system (OS) instances, and the connection broker. In this article, I'd like to take a more detailed look at the connection broker and some of the functionality that brokers provide in a VDI deployment.

A few more VDI-centric articles are in the works, so stay tuned here and to SearchVMware.com. Thanks for reading!
