Up until now, I haven't really messed around with listening to podcasts. I know all about them, what they are, how they work, and all that wonderful jazz. But I typically have not listened to podcasts at all.

I'm not really sure why, although I suppose it could be due to not having some podcasts that I really find useful or enjoyable.

So I'll toss it back to you, the readers, for your feedback. Are there podcasts out there that you find useful? What podcasts would you recommend for a guy like me?
