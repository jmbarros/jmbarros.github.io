I finally got back from my family vacation in Florida. It was (for the most part) a very relaxing two weeks. I had the opportunity to visit a small [Church of God](http://www.churchofgod.cc/) congregation in Kissimmee, FL (the Living Waters Church of God---if you live in the area or are going to be visiting the area, go by and see them) and was alerted to a potential ministry for my wife and I within the church. We'll see where God leads with that. Of course, I also had the chance to see some theme parks, swim in the pool, go to the beach, and spend some time with my family. All in all, a well-deserved and well-enjoyed vacation.
