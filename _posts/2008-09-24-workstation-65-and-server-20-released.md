Via Duncan on Twitter, I saw that VMware Workstation 6.5 and VMware Server 2.0 have been released:

[VMware Workstation 6.5 Download Page](http://www.vmware.com/download/ws/)  

[VMware Server 2.0 Download Page](http://www.vmware.com/download/server/)

Some of the key features in Workstation 6.5 include "Unity," the seamless windowing technology that first debuted in VMware Fusion; support for Windows Server 2008; enhanced VMware ACE authoring; and virtual machine streaming. (This last feature was originally demonstrated at VMworld 2007, so it's nice to see VMware finally getting this technology into production.)

New features in Server 2.0 include support for Windows Server 2008; support for 64-bit Linux hosts and expanded 64-bit guest support; new VMware Remote Console to allow access to virtual machine consoles independent of the VI Web Access interface; VSS support; and VMI support for transparent paravirtualization.

Refer to the VMware web site for more information on either of these products.
