The article, titled "Five Ways to Get Vista's Security Now," discusses five options for getting the equivalent of Vista's [User Account Control](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/windowsvista/security/uac.mspx) (UAC) functionality on today's Windows. UAC is one of the most widely touted new security features in [Windows Vista](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/windowsvista/default.mspx) because it eliminates the security hole that is created by needing to log in with an administrative-level user account (many applications won't run properly without administrative permissions).

There's nothing new here in terms of uncovering functionality that most security-conscious users didn't already know about; the options included the following:

* Logging in as a limited user (not really an option because so many things stop working);

* Using "Run As" to run applications like the web browser and/or e-mail client as a limited user;

* Using [Process Explorer](http://www.sysinternals.com/Utilities/ProcessExplorer.html) to run applications in a limited security context (does not require a separate limited user account); and

* Using an application that automates the process of running applications with limited permissions (the article suggests [DropMyRights](http://msdn.microsoft.com/security/securecode/columns/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dncode/html/secure11152004.asp)).

These are all good options (except for the first one), but it's option number 5 that makes me chuckle: Get a Mac.

The article has this to say about why getting a Mac and switching to [Mac OS X](http://www.apple.com/macosx/) is a good option:

>If Vista's UAC is a copy of Mac OS X's approach, why not stare in the horse's mouth?

Why not indeed? The introduction of Intel-based Macs and the rise of near-native speed virtualization options such as [Parallels Desktop](http://www.parallels.com/en/products/desktop/) make this quite viable. In my opinion, it's like having your cake and eating it, too.
