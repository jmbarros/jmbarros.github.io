I first discussed VIMA, the VMware Infrastructure Management Assistant, in the [liveblog of TA2659][1] ("Managing ESX in a COS-less World") during VMworld 2008. Refer back to the TA2659 liveblog for more details on the features and functionality of VIMA.

[Via VMwarewolf](http://www.vmwarewolf.com/download-vima-today/), I learned that VIMA 1.0 has been released and is now available as [a free download](http://www.vmware.com/support/developer/vima/index.html). Go check it out!
