In all the [noise surrounding Cisco UCS][1], a couple of other smaller news releases were drowned out.

[Leostream](http://www.leostream.com/) has partnered with [NoMachine](http://nomachine.com/) that will see Leostream integrating NoMachine's NX protocol into their connection broker in order to support Linux-based virtual hosted desktops. You can read the full news release is [here](http://www.leostream.com/news/pr_03_16_09.php) or [here](http://nomachine.com/news-read.php?idnews=267). This will allow Leostream to try to gain ground on VMware View by supporting not only Windows-based hosted virtual desktops, but also virtual desktops running Linux. I think this is a good move by Leostream to further differentiate themselves from market leader VMware, but whether it will be enough to make a difference is another story.

Also today, [Rove](http://www.roveit.com/) released version 4.2 of their [Mobile Admin](http://www.roveit.com/mobileadmin/overview/) product, a product designed to allow administators to manage their infrastructure from the ever-present mobile device. The press release is available [here](http://www.roveit.com/newsroom/pressarchive/2009/2009-03-16_2009%20MobileAdmin42Release.aspx). Rove offered to provide a trial for me to use, but as they don't yet offer a native iPhone version of Mobile Admin, I had to decline. (Rove is quick to point out that you can use Mobile Safari on the iPhone to access the web version of their application, however. Personally, I prefer native applications.) Mobile Admin is available for the BlackBerry and for Windows Mobile. If you're in need of some sort of mobile administration solution, this might fit the bill. I'd love to hear from some readers who have used this product---is it good?
