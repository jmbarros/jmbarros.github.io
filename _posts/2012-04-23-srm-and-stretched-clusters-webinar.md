This coming Thursday, April 26, I'll be participating in an EMC webinar titled "Best Practices: When and How to Use Stretched Clusters." (I wanted to title it as "Current Recommended Practices," but the marketing group shot me down.) The webinar starts at 8 AM PT/9 AM MT/11 AM ET.

This webinar will discuss whether stretched clusters or a solution like VMware Site Recovery Manager is a better fit for your needs, as well as provide some guidelines around the use of stretched clusters as of vSphere 5.0.

If you're interested in registering for the webinar, visit [the registration page](http://ow.ly/as4Q4) and sign up. Thanks!
