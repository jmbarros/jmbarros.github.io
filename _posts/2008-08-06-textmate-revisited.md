About a month ago, I blogged about [trying TextMate][1] as my text editor of choice. After almost a month, I've gone ahead and purchased a license for TextMate and I'm sticking with it.

I'm still convinced that I'm not even scratching the surface of this application's functionality, but I like the way TextMate works. I have a few minor UI quibbles (I'd rather see a HUD-style overlay instead of the yellow "tool tip" look for word count, for example), but overall I'm happy with the application.

If there any readers out there who use TextMate primarily for technical writing and not development, I'd love to hear your feedback, including suggestions for additional bundles or plug-ins that you find helpful.
