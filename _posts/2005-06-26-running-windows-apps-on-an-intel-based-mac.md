Here's an interesting side effect of Apple's announcement to move the Macintosh platform to Intel-based CPUs: [CodeWeavers](http://www.codeweavers.com/) has announced that they will expand their services and products to include the new Intel-based Macs (see [CodeWeavers sees Mactel move as an opportunity](http://business.newsforge.com/article.pl?sid=05/06/24/1530234&from=rss) on the [NewsForge](http://www.newsforge.com/) site). More information is also available in the official CodeWeavers [press release](http://www.codeweavers.com/about/general/press/?id=20050622).

This is a very good thing. If CodeWeavers is successful in making a version of [CrossOver Office](http://www.codeweavers.com/products/cxoffice/) to run on the Intel-based Macs, it will make it easier to users to choose whatever platform best suits their needs, be it [Windows](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/), Linux, or [Mac OS X](http://www.apple.com/macosx/). They won't feel tied to a specific platform just because there's _one_ application they need that only runs on _one_ specific platform.

Right now, I use Microsoft's [Virtual PC for the Mac](http://www.microsoft.com/mac/products/virtualpc/virtualpc.aspx) to run any Windows-specific programs I need. This works reasonably well, but takes a performance hit because it has to emulate an Intel-compatible CPU. With Intel-based CPUs under the hood already, Virtual PC (or CrossOver Office, or [VMware](http://www.vmware.com/), or [Xen](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/Research/SRG/netos/xen/), or any other emulation software) will practically fly. This makes emulation a much more attractive option than it is right now. That, in turn, means more choice and more freedom for end users.
