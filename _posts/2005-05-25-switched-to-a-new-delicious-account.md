As part of the process of trying to clean up all the various accounts and subscriptions and what not that I have out there, I have switched to a new [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us/) account. You can now find my bookmark list at [del.icio.us/slowe](http://del.icio.us/slowe/).

Does anyone know how to close an old del.icio.us account?
