Sanbolic is continuing to differentiate its clustered file system, Melio FS, in advance of the rudimentary clustered file system Microsoft plans on introducing in Windows Server 2008 R2. In an announcement last week, Sanbolic announced support for fully journaled snapshots. This functionality allows any server accessing the clustered file system to invoke a snapshot. The new snapshot functionality provides support for VSS and "full industry standard APIs," although I'm not really sure what those "full industry standard APIs" are exactly.

You can download the full press release describing the new functionality [here](http://www.sanbolic.com/pdfs/Sanbolic_Press_Release_VSS_Final.pdf).

Separately, Sanbolic also announced that Melio FS fully supports Microsoft System Center Virtual Machine Manager 2008; more information on that is [also available](http://www.sanbolic.com/pdfs/Sanbolic_Press_Release_SCVMM_2008R2.pdf).

Now, if only Sanbolic would port Melio FS to VMware ESX/ESXi, then we could have some _really_ interesting discussions. Snapshot functionality built into the shared file system, anyone?
