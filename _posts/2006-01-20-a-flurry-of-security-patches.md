Over this past week, a wide collection of vendors have released patches for various vulnerabilities and flaws in their applications. Here's a quick recap of some of the security patches released this past week.

* _Oracle:_ [Oracle](http://www.oracle.com/) [released patches for more than 100 flaws](http://feeds.computerworld.com/Computerworld/Security/News?m=243) in their database and application server products.

* _Symantec/Veritas:_ [Symantec](http://www.symantec.com/) [released patches for its NetBackup application](http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1912358,00.asp) (acquired with Veritas) after exploit code was released on the Internet. It does not appear that this flaw also affects the more-popular Backup Exec application.

* _"Do It Yourself" Trojan Builder:_ [Sunbelt Software](http://www.sunbeltsoftware.com/) claims to have [uncovered a do-it-yourself Trojan builder](http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1913061,00.asp) that allows unsophisticated crackers to build applications for identity theft and fraud. Does this signal a new era for the "script kiddie"?

Of course, this list doesn't include the patches from [Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.com/) that were released last week, which included [fixes for two 'critical' e-mail server flaws](http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1909647,00.asp).

As usual, the activity in software patching is another reminder that we must continue to be vigilant in the construction and maintenance of our networks.
