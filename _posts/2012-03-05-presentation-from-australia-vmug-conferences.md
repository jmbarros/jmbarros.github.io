In early December of last year, I had the great opportunity to travel to Australia to participate in the inaugural full-day VMUG conferences in both Brisbane and Melbourne. I have been remiss in publishing the presentation that I gave at those meetings, so I'm fixing that now!

Here is [a link to the presentation][1].

As always, if you have any questions, clarifications, or thoughts, please feel free to speak up in the comments. Thanks!

**UPDATE:** In the blog migration at the end of 2014, all embedded presentations were converted to linked presentations.
