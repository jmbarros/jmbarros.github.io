Via [this Twitter post](http://twitter.com/vmware/statuses/1114634112), I learned that VMware has posted a [new KB article](http://kb.vmware.com/selfservice/microsites/search.do?language=en_US&cmd=displayKC&externalId=1008130) about a  SAN I/O failure that can occur with VMware ESX and ESXi 3.5 Update 3. If you are using VMware ESX or ESXi 3.5 Update 3, please be sure to read the KB article and stay tuned here for additional updates. I will update this post when I get more information.
