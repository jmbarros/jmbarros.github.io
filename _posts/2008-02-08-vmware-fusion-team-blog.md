I just received a note from VMware announcing the launch of the VMware Fusion Team blog, aka [Team Fusion](http://blogs.vmware.com/teamfusion/). The RSS feed for Team Fusion is [here](http://blogs.vmware.com/teamfusion/rss.xml).

If you are a Fusion fan, as I am, then it's worthwhile to add this to your list of RSS feeds or favorite sites to visit.
