I'm not a Solaris expert, nor a SPARC expert, nor even a longtime user of their products. But I do have a lot of respect for their recent engineering efforts in the x86 space, particularly those hardware products released since Andy Bechtolsheim's return with the acquisition of Kealia a couple of years ago. The move to open-source Solaris, the increasing visibility of OpenSolaris, the introduction of exciting new technologies such as ZFS...all these things have been building up the "tech cred" that Sun needs to win back (or continue to hold on to) the hearts and minds of technical leaders. And then this happens---they announce they're [changing the stock ticker symbol from SUNW to JAVA](http://blogs.sun.com/jonathan/entry/java_is_everywhere). Huh?

Is it just me, or does this not make sense? I suppose I kind of see the reasoning behind the move, although I don't agree with the reasoning. It all smacks of rebranding all the products with Java, even though most of them didn't (and don't) have anything to do with Java.

It all just seems silly to me.
