BlueStripe Software has released version 1.1 of its flagship product, FactFinder. Readers may recall that I [met with BlueStripe][1] back during the VMworld 2008 timeframe, and I've spoken with them on a number of occasions at other times as well.

Improvements in the new version include:

* Application-centric views give users the ability to more easily see application dependencies within the overall IT infrastructure

* Task and user workflow reporting allows users to benchmark application performance before, during, and after migrations (P2V, V2P, or V2V) to help identify changes and potential areas of concern

* More in-depth detail reporting allows FactFinder to correlate additional on the servers on which it resides

The full press release is available [here as a PDF](http://www.bluestripe.com/intranet/downloadManagerControl.php?mode=getFile&elementID=380&type=5&atomID=164).
