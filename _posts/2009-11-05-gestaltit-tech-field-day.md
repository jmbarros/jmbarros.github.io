In the event you haven't heard, [Gestalt IT](http://gestaltit.com) has organized the Gestalt IT Field Day to take place next week, November 12 and 13, somewhere on the West Coast. This is a very exciting event that brings together multiple vendors and multiple bloggers to discuss their technology and their products in a non-NDA environment. This is a great way for companies to help increase knowledge and awareness of their products. Be prepared, though, to get both the good and the bad---most bloggers won't hold back!

The list of blogger attendees is an all-star list of folks like (in no particular order) [Rich Brambley](http://vmetc.com/), [Chris Evans](http://thestoragearchitect.com/), [Robin Harris](http://storagemojo.com/), [Greg Ferro](http://etherealmind.com/), [Rod Haywood](http://rodos.haywood.org/), [John Obeto](http://www.absolutelywindows.com/), [Nigel Poulton](http://blogs.rupturedmonkey.com/), [Simon Seagrave](http://www.techhead.co.uk/), and more! This is quite a gathering of folks. The sponsor companies should be very grateful to get in front of this audience!

Although I wasn't able to make it to this event, I'm hopeful that Gestalt IT will organize future events that I will be able to attend. In the meantime, though, look for some great information from these folks next week!
