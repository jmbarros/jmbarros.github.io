The level of comment spam I've been receiving over the last few days has suddenly skyrocketed (as in approximately 200 spam comments in just a couple of days). It was time to do something.

That something was [Akismet](http://askismet.com/), a highly-regarded spam mechanism for blocking comment and trackback spam. I've now installed Akismet to protect this weblog, so we'll see how well it works. Blog spammers beware!
