I received an e-mail from David Marshall of [Hyper9](http://www.hyper9.com/) (David also runs [VMBlog.com](http://www.vmblog.com/)) with some good news: Hyper9 has had their strongest quarter yet, despite the less-than-ideal economic conditions. Hyper9's Virtual Environment Optimization (VEO) is a pretty well-regarded solution, and based on the limited hands-on time I've spent with it I like it. So, congratulations to Hyper9 for providing a bright spot in the economic landscape. Well done, guys!
