I've been meaning to write about this young Christian rock artist for a while now, but keep forgetting. Finally, here it is.

I picked up Krystal Meyers' debut self-titled CD a few months ago from Sound and Spirit (one of the BMG Music clubs---you know, where they send you constant reminders to buy CDs from them and then ship them to you the instant you forget to tell them you don't want them). I initially bought it just for fun; I had never heard of Krystal Meyers and wasn't entirely sure I would even like the music. Worst case scenario, I could give the CD to one of my kids.

I was in for a surprise. The music is _really_ good. This is one of my favorite CDs already, and I'm looking forward to hearing the next album. If you're looking for a good message grounded in the Gospel but wrapped in great-sounding rock music, this album is a good choice.
