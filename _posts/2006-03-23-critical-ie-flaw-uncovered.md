Word has surfaced of a critical Internet Explorer flaw that could allow remote code execution, and which affects all versions save the very latest builds of Internet Explorer 7.

[Secunia](http://secunia.com/) has posted an [advisory](http://secunia.com/advisories/18680/), and a [brief blog entry](http://blogs.technet.com/msrc/archive/2006/03/22/422849.aspx) on the [Microsoft Security Response Center blog](http://blogs.technet.com/msrc/) discusses the vulnerability as well. No action is required on behalf of the user other than to visit an affected web site. The only workaround at this time is to disable Active Scripting, which breaks the functionality of many other sites at the same time.

Oh, wait...there is another workaround. Use [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/).
