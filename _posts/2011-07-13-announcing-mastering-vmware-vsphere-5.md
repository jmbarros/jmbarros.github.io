Now that the lid has been officially lifted on VMware vSphere 5 (see my initial launch coverage [here][1]), I'm finally able to discuss a significant project that has been consuming a great deal of my free time for the last several months: _Mastering VMware vSphere 5_.

Yes, that's right---there will be a new revision of my best-selling book on vSphere 4, completely updated and refreshed for vSphere 5. The previous edition, _[Mastering VMware vSphere 4](http://www.amazon.com/Mastering-VMware-vSphere-Computer-Tech/dp/0470481382/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1310543180&sr=8-1)_, received rave reviews and was very well-received by the VMware community, selling over 20,000 copies since its release at VMworld 2009.

In the new revision for vSphere 5, you'll find coverage included on the major new features:

* Storage DRS
* Profile-driven storage
* VMFS-5
* New hardware offloads in VAAI v2
* The Linux-based vCenter Server virtual appliance

As in the previous edition, I've done my best to supply comprehensive coverage of the entire product suite, from installation to networking to storage, security, and automation. This book won't go as deep as some other book on the market, but that's not really its purpose. _Mastering VMware vSphere 5_ is targeted at getting you as much relevant, real-world information as possible to help you manage and optimize your vSphere 5 environment.

Right now, we're targeting availability of _Mastering VMware vSphere 5_  around September 20, 2011. Due to the vSphere 5 release schedule, it was almost impossible to have the book ready any sooner. It will be available for pre-order via Amazon.com very soon. (In fact, some have said that the new book has already shown up on the Amazon UK site.) The book should be available in both print form and electronic form almost simultaneously.

As soon as the book is available for pre-order, I'll update this article accordingly.
