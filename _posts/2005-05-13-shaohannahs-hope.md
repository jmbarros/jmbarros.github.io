I believe that we should support adoption as an alternative to abortion. In the absence of a serious medical need to abort a baby, there seems no reason to me to kill a baby when lots of couples would love to adopt that child and raise it as their own. That's especially true when they can't have children of their own naturally. Of course, when it comes to a subject like this everyone has their own opinion. That's OK.

If you believe like I do, then I would encourage you to look into supporting [Shaohannah's Hope](http://www.shaohannahshope.org/).  This organization, launched by [Steven Curtis Chapman](http://www.stevencurtischapman.com/) and his wife, Mary Beth Chapman, seeks to encourage adoption as a Christian ministry. It's something worth praying about.
