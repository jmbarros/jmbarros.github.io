In case you hadn't already heard elsewhere, our good friends at [Hyper9 ](http://www.hyper9.com/)have released the final version of [Virtualization Mobile Manager (VMM)](http://www.hyper9.com/lp/vmm/). VMM works with VMware Infrastructure 3, VMware vSphere 4, Microsoft Hyper-V, and Citrix XenServer 5. Users can use VMM with just about any mobile device, including the Apple iPhone, Blackberry, Google Android, and Windows Mobile devices.

VMM is available for users to manage up to five virtual machines for free. Hyper9 is also offering special introductory pricing of only $199 to manage up to 1,000 virtual machines.
