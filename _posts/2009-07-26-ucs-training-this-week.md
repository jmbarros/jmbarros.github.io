I'll be in San Jose, CA, all week for hands-on Cisco Unified Computing System training at the old Nuova Systems location. UCS has seen a great deal of attention, but the chance this week to actually get my hands on the UCS equipment will afford me the ability to form a more concrete opinion on the product, its strengths, and its weaknesses (yes, every product has weaknesses).

Now that first customer ship (FCS) for UCS has occurred---it happened last week, if I recall correctly---I'm hoping that the majority of the material being presented in the training class is material that I'll be able to share both here on the blog and [via Twitter](http://twitter.com/scott_lowe). I don't know exactly how much I'll be allowed to share, but be assured I'll share as much as possible. All the posts will be [tagged "UCS"][1] to make it a bit easier to find them.

If anyone has any specific pieces of information they'd like me to find out about UCS, post a comment here and I'll try to get an answer this week. Please _don't_ ask about pricing or discounts or the like; try to keep the questions technical in nature. Thanks!
