A friend and colleague of mine recently launched a blog of his own, [The Blade Blog](http://aarondelp.blogspot.com/). If the useful information that's been posted there so far is any indication, this will be a definite addition to your RSS subscriptions. Keep up the good work, Aaron!

**UPDATE:** After some great feedback on the launch of his site, Aaron's moved away from Blogger to a hosted WordPress solution and has gotten a new domain name. You can now find Aaron at the [Blade Vault](http://bladevault.info/). More information and updated URLs available [here][1] and [here](http://aarondelp.blogspot.com/2008/02/new-site-new-name.html).
