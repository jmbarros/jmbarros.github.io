Many of you probably use [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us/), or have at least heard of it. You may not have heard of a native [Mac OS X](http://www.apple.com/macosx/) client for del.icio.us called [Cocoalicious](http://www.scifihifi.com/cocoalicious/). If you use del.icio.us and Mac OS X, you should give this application a try.
