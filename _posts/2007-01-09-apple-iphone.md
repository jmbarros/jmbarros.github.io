In case you've been hiding under a rock and haven't yet heard (is that possible?), Apple today announced the iPhone:

[http://www.apple.com/iphone](http://www.apple.com/iphone)

GSM/EDGE, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth...runs an embedded form of OS X...super-slick user interface...it's enough to make a gadget geek like me salivate.

If the iPhone works half as well as claimed, it will be a tremendous device. If it works as well as claimed, it will be a revolutionary device.

So, yes, I don't technically _need_ one...but I sure would like to have one.
