Andrew Kutz has published a [guide to developing plugins](http://itknowledgeexchange.techtarget.com/virtualization-pro/vmware-infrastructure-35-plugin-and-extension-programming-guide/) for VMware Infrastructure 3.5. More information on the developers guide is available in this blog posting from Andrew on the [Virtualization Pro](http://itknowledgeexchange.techtarget.com/virtualization-pro/) site.

The developers guide is the result of Andrew's work in creating plugins for VI3 version 3.5. The first plugin was a [plugin for Storage VMotion][1], which was released about a week or so ago. Since that time, Andrew has also released a plugin for creating port groups across multiple ESX Servers.

Good work, Andrew!
