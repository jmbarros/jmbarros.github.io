Over the last couple of days at VMworld, I've had the opportunity to meet up with a couple of vendors to discuss their product initiatives and offerings. I had lined up several more meetings, but due to my hectic schedule I was unable to make those meetings. To those companies that I missed, I apologize. There just aren't enough hours in the day!

## Bluesocket

One company that I met with is [Bluesocket](http://www.bluesocket.com/), whose link to VMware is through their vWLAN (virtual wireless LAN) product. What is a vWLAN, exactly? Don't worry, I asked the same question; it sounded like bad marketing, to be honest. vWLAN is the name they use to describe a wireless network architecture that combines wireless APs with a fully virtualized wireless AP controller. Bluesocket has taken their wireless network architecture and built it in such a way that they've combined the traits of a "fat AP" and "thin AP" approach together, and leveraged virtualization on vSphere to provide the compute power. It's an interesting approach, but---as I expressed to Bluesocket---I'm not sure how well it will hold off the bigger, more well-funded competitors in the wireless LAN space. For now, at least, Bluesocket has a first mover's advantage.

## HyTrust

[HyTrust](http://www.hytrust.com/) is a company I've written about before (just do a Google search for "HyTrust site:scottlowe.org"). HyTrust is in a very interesting space and doing some pretty cool things. I learned today, for example, that not only does HyTrust provide support for VMware vSphere and the Cisco Nexus 1000V, but also Cisco UCS. That's pretty cool! If you are looking for some ways to enhance the security profile of your virtualized environment, it might be worthwhile for you to take a look at HyTrust.

Well, that's it for now. I'll have more VMworld 2011 coverage tomorrow.
