It's about time. I've been waiting for someone to take revolutionary (in my opinion, at least) technologies such as virtualization, blade servers (or any alternative server form factors), and thin-client access and combine them. And that's exactly what [IBM](http://www.ibm.com/), [VMware](http://www.vmware.com/), and [Citrix](http://www.citrix.com/) are doing, as discussed [here](http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1873113,00.asp).

Leveraging their individual strengths (IBM's hardware, VMware's virtualization, and Citrix's access technologies), the group is rolling out a hosted client infrastructure that will compete directly with so-called "blade PCs" (from companies such as [ClearCube](http://www.clearcube.com/controller/home.php)) and traditional thin clients (from companies such as [Wyse](http://www.wyse.com/index.htm) and [Neoware](http://www.neoware.com/)). The nice thing about this solution is that it works equally well with full PCs and thin client devices.

This is good stuff. IBM's blade servers are well-respected, and IBM's integration of their blades with technologies from Cisco Systems (such as their Cisco Systems Intelligent Gigabit Ethernet Switch Module for the IBM eServer BladeCenter, more information available [here](http://www-132.ibm.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?productId=8712463&storeId=1&langId=-1&catalogId=-840)) gives them a leg up on the competitors. As for virtualization...well, VMware invented the market, and while [Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.com/) may be offering a virtualization product of its own they have a long way to go to catch up. VMware's latest version of [ESX Server](http://www.vmware.com/products/esx/)  offers much-improved resource utilization and scheduling functionality, particularly when used in combination with the latest version of [VirtualCenter](http://www.vmware.com/products/vc/). Likewise, Citrix pioneered multi-user Windows and the ICA protocol, and they continue to innovate in recent versions of [Presentation Manager](http://www.citrix.com/English/ps2/products/product.asp?contentID=186&ntref=hp_nav_US).

Combining these technologies to create a dynamic environment where users are seamlessly connected to virtual servers hosted on and across multiple blade servers is a natural evolution for each of these technologies. (I would guess that I don't need to point out how full circle this brings enterprise computing environments.)
