Andrew Kutz has launched [viplugins.com](http://www.lostcreations.com/code/wiki/vmware/viplugins), a home for developing and distributing plugins for VirtualCenter 2.5. This launch comes on the heels of the [recently released Storage VMotion plugin][1], which provides a graphical interface to Storage VMotion.

Quoting from the site:

>Welcome to your first and last stop on this wide world of webs for all of your VMware Infrastructure (VI) plugin needs...therefore invite all soon-to-be, current, future (whenever you are reading this) VI plugin developers to make this site the "goto" location for VI plugin development.

In addition, Andrew's released the [Add Port Groups plugin](http://www.lostcreations.com/code/wiki/vmware/viplugins/addportgroups), which helps automate the creation of port groups across multiple ESX Servers.

Good work, Andrew!
