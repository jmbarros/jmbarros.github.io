I'm very excited to announce the [inaugural OpenStack Denver meetup](http://www.meetup.com/OpenStack-Denver/events/95744912/), scheduled for 7 PM on Wednesday, January 9, 2013--only 6 days away!

If you haven't already joined the meetup group, please head over to the [group page on Meetup.com](http://www.meetup.com/OpenStack-Denver/) and join, then RSVP for the inaugural OpenStack Denver meeting. Cisco Systems was kind enough to sponsor the event, both by hosting us at their Englewood office (near Park Meadows Mall) as well as by supplying food (pizza) and drinks (soda/water).

At the inaugural meeting, we'll first provide an OpenStack primer, so those who aren't familiar with OpenStack will get an idea of what it's all about and what's included. Next, co-organizer Shannon McFarland will talk about what Cisco's been doing with OpenStack, and then we'll wrap up the first meetup with a discussion of desired future topics, speakers, and other logistical items.

This is going to be a great opportunity to meet other folks in the Denver area who are also interested in or working with OpenStack, so I highly encourage you to do your best to make it. See you there!
