In the short period of time since I mentioned the [Virtual Machine MKS Client](http://www.ntpro.nl/blog/categories/7-Virtual-Machine-MKS-Client) in my post on [assorted VMware tools][1], the client has gone from version 1.1 to version 1.8 and has added tons of functionality. Some of the features include:

* The ability to logon to either VirtualCenter or the ESX Server directly
* Multiple view options, including full screen and borderless
* Ability to send Ctrl-Alt-Del signal to VM
* Warning/alarm feedback from VirtualCenter into the MKS client
* Full power off/suspend/power on/reset functionality

I'm sure there's more, but that should definitely get you started. It looks like an absolutely fantastic application, but unfortunately I can't use it because it's designed to run on Windows and I primarily use a Mac. Any enterprising MKS programmers out there (per Mike Laverick, apparently there's quite the [MKS programming contest going on](http://www.rtfm-ed.co.uk/?p=408)) want to create an MKS client for Mac OS X?
