Like [Alessandro at virtualization.info](http://www.virtualization.info/2007/09/virtualizationinfo-will-blog-live-from.html) and [Vincent at Virtrix](http://virtrix.blogspot.com/2007/09/virtrix-will-blog-live-from-vmworld.html), I'll be liveblogging next week from VMworld 2007 in San Francisco, CA, USA. (I actually thought I had announced this fact in a previous blog post about VMworld 2007, but I went back and looked and apparently I didn't. Go figure.)

I've never done any liveblogging before, so it will be interesting to see how it turns out. Still, with all the exciting announcements that are expected next week, I don't think there's any better time to try out my liveblogging skills. With so many other bloggers and news outlets covering the keynotes and shows, I'm sure there will be a fair amount of duplication, but I'll do my best to keep things reasonably fresh and not a "copy-and-paste" from elsewhere.

Thanks for visiting, and stay tuned!
