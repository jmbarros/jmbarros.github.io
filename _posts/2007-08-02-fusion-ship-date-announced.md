As is being reported throughout the Internet, [VMware](http://www.vmware.com/) has announced that their [VMware Fusion](http://www.vmware.com/mac/) product, which provides virtualization functionality for Intel-based Macs, will ship on August 6. I won't repeat the long list of features that Fusion provides (other sites have covered that very well), but I will state that I have been using Fusion since the very beginning (before the public beta, there was a "Friends and Family" release). I met some of the developers last year at VMworld 2006, and they have done an awesome job with this product. Regis, Ben, and the rest of the team: Fantastic work! Now on to Fusion 2.0!
