After wrestling with installing, configuring, and supporting Fedora Core 3 on an older Compaq Armada E500 laptop, I decided to break with my Red Hat/Fedora legacy and try [Kubuntu](http://kubuntu.org/), the [KDE](http://www.kde.org/)-based [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntulinux.org/) variation. Ubuntu itself is a relative newcomer to the Linux distribution arena, based on (as I understand it) [Debian](http://www.debian.org/).

In previous stints using Linux as my desktop OS, I'd always been partial to KDE instead of [GNOME](http://www.gnome.org/). Some would say that it's because KDE has traditionally been more "Windows-like" than the other Linux graphical environments; perhaps that's the case. I've typically found KDE easier to work with, and since this laptop would eventually be used by the kids I felt like ease of use was important.

The install went very quickly and very smoothly. When the install was done, I then proceeded to update KDE to version 3.5.0 (which had just been released a few days before). Along the way, I learned a handy piece of information about HTTP proxies and command-line utilities (I'll soon post information on that as well). Eventually, I managed to get `apt-get` to download and install the updated KDE 3.5 packages. I rebooted the system and found that I was now running the updated version of KDE. (Side note: There are still some KDE packages that won't upgrade for some reason; I'm currently working on resolving that issue.)

It's still too early to tell for certain, but I may just have found a new desktop Linux version.
