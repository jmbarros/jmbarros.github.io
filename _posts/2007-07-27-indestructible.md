How many of us would like to be indestructible? To know that no matter what happens, no matter what comes against us, we cannot be destroyed or killed? It would be pretty cool, right?

Well, here's a newsflash, given to me courtesy of [Pastor Greg Laurie on the radio](http://www.harvest.org/radio/) yesterday on my way to Charlotte, NC for a meeting: for Christian believers, we are _indestructible_.

That's right, we're indestructible. To paraphrase what Pastor Greg had to say: Until God is ready for us to come home to Heaven, we are indestructible. No plots schemed against us, no attacks targeted at us, no lies told about us---nothing---can destroy us. Why? Because it's not God's will! When God is ready for us to leave here and go to Heaven (i.e., when our time is up), we'll go. Until that time, we won't. It's as simple as that. Until God is ready for us to be with Him in Heaven, we are indestructible.

Of course, that doesn't mean we should test God, and Pastor Greg pointed that out. But what it _does_ mean is that we don't have to live in constant fear. Should we take reasonable steps to protect ourselves, our families, and our friends? Of course. God gave us a brain so that we would use it. But after taking reasonable steps, we don't have to live in fear. Why? You've got it---because we're indestructible!

So, if you're facing a challenge, facing a mountain ahead of you, if your opponents are lining up against you (and believe me, I've been there before), take heart and be encouraged. You, my Christian friend and believer, are _**indestructible**_.
