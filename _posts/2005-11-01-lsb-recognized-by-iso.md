[News surfaced today](http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1880214,00.asp) that the [International Organization for Standardization](http://www.iso.org/iso/en/ISOOnline.frontpage) (ISO) has approved the Linux Standards Base (LSB) as an international standard. The LSB 2.0.1 core specification has been accepted by the ISO and will be published as [International Standard 23360](http://www.iso.org/iso/en/CatalogueDetailPage.CatalogueDetail?CSNUMBER=41481&scopelist=PROGRAMME).

In my eyes, this is a big indicator of Linux's maturity. Does Linux still need growth in some areas to be more competitive with [Microsoft Windows](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/), [Novell NetWare](http://www.novell.com/netware/), [Solaris](http://www.sun.com/software/solaris/), or [Mac OS X](http://www.apple.com/macosx/)? Yes, certainly. And yet, at the same time, Linux has strengths all its own as well. This recognition by the ISO of the Linux Standards Base serves to further legitimize Linux as a viable and worthy competitor to the proprietary operating systems listed above.

(By the way, you'll note that I did not include Novell's [Open Enterprise Server](http://www.novell.com/products/openenterpriseserver/) in the list of operating systems above because it is, of course, based on Linux.)
