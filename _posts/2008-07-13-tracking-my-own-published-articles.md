For those that are interested, I've started bookmarking all my own published articles. They're viewable [on Delicious.com with the tag "Articles"](http://delicious.com/slowe/Articles), and you can also subscribe to the [RSS feed for that tag](http://feeds.delicious.com/v2/rss/slowe/Articles) as well. I was having a hard time keeping track of all the URLs where my articles had been published, so I thought I'd just go ahead and bookmark them so I had them for future reference.

I hadn't really considered that doing this would also help me judge the popularity and/or usefulness of the article, as measured by the number of other people who also have it bookmarked. Of course, it also doesn't hurt that this makes it easier for other people to find them as well. (Hey, you can't blame me too much for wanting to promote my own work!)
