So here's another "thinking out loud" post. This time, I'm thinking about Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE) and unified fabric.

I was going back through a list of blog posts and articles that I wanted to read and think on, and I came across a link to Dave Graham's article titled [Moving a Fabric forward: FCoE Adoption and other Questions](http://flickerdown.com/2008/12/moving-a-fabric-forward-fcoe-adoption-and-other-questions/). His blog entry was partially in response to my [FCoE discussion post][1]. His post got me thinking again.

It seems like anytime someone talks about FCoE, they end up also talking about unified fabric. After having read a number of different articles and posts regarding FCoE, I can see where FCoE would be attractive to shops with significant FCP installations. In my mind, though, this doesn't necessarily mean unified fabric. Given the political differences in organizations---think the "storage team" and the "networking team"---how likely is it that an organization may adopt FCoE, but not unified fabric? Or how likely is it that an organization may adopt FCoE, intending it to be a transitional technology leading to unified fabric, but never actually make it all the way?

So here's my question: is unified fabric an inevitability?

(Oh, and here's a related question: Most people cite VoIP as proof that the unified fabric is inevitable. More so than anything else, I believe VoIP's success was more a reflection of the rising importance of TCP/IP networking. If so, does that give iSCSI an edge over FCoE? Is iSCSI the "VoIP of the storage world"?)
