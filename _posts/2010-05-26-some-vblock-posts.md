The Vblock is starting to get a bit more attention, which is a good thing. Part of it is driven by an increased awareness of the Vblock as a solution; I'd like to think of that as something Ed Saipetch and I had a little to do with after our [Gestalt IT Tech Field Day](http://gestaltit.com/field-day/2010-boston/) presentation in Boston, but I'm not so naive as to actually believe that. However, I am confident that part of the increased visibility and discussion around Vblock is due to the continued investment and continued persistence by all three members of the VCE Coalition. Regardless of the reason, I've collected a few Vblock posts here for your continued enjoyment:
