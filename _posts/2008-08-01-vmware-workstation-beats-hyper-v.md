If this is indeed accurate, then this is big news. The Hypervisor recently published a [comparison between VMware Workstation 6 and Hyper-V](http://www.thehypervisor.com/?p=57), and found that VMware Workstation 6 was _**faster**_ than Hyper-V for a variety of tasks.

This is quite surprising, and I'm hoping we won't find out that the testers installed VMware Tools for VMware Workstation but didn't use the enlightenments for Hyper-V (or some other similar move). That would just be wrong. If you're going to use optimizations available on one platform, you should also use optimizations on the other platform as well.

In the meantime, if anyone turns up more information on this comparison and the details behind the comparison, I'd love to hear it.
