It seems this is the week for catching up on stuff that I should have done a long time ago! Earlier in the week it was posting [a video of the stretched cluster presentation][1] I gave back in May at the Carolina VMware User Summit; this time it's finally getting around to posting the presentation I gave at the Denver VMUG back at the end of June.

The presentation is on vSphere network design considerations and discusses some of the more commonly-encountered questions/issues regarding vSphere network designs. I hope that you get something useful from it.

Here is [a link to the presentation][2] on Slideshare.

As always, I welcome any questions, suggestions, or other feedback in the comments. Thank you for reading!
