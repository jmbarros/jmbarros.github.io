Shamelessly copied (mostly) from both [Yellow Bricks](http://www.yellow-bricks.com/2009/06/12/vmworld-2009-ta2259-ask-the-experts-panel-session/) and [VMwareTips.com](http://vmwaretips.com/wp/2009/06/12/vmworld-2009-ta2259-ask-the-experts-panel-session/). I didn't think either Duncan or Rick would mind very much.

I am proud to officially announce the VMworld 2009 - Ask the Experts Panel Session. This session will feature virtualization experts Rick Scherer, Scott Lowe, Duncan Epping, Chad Sakac and Tom Howarth answering your questions on virtual infrastructure design.
