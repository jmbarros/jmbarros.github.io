Mark one up for cross-platform standards: the OpenDocument format, an XML-based file format originally derived from work on [OpenOffice.org](http://www.openoffice.org/) (and Sun's [StarOffice](http://www.sun.com/software/star/staroffice/index.jsp)) has been officially approved as an ISO standard.

There are numerous announcements of the approval---[this _eWeek_ article](http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1957321,00.asp), which initially alerted me; this [press release](http://www.openoffice.org/press/iso_pr.html) at the OpenOffice.org web site; and [this blog entry](http://www.consortiuminfo.org/standardsblog/article.php?story=20060503080915835) by Andy Updegrove, a participant in the standardization committees.

Of course, [Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.com/) continues to push its Open XML format as an alternative to ODF. The push for ODF was never really about taking power away from Microsoft, though; it was really about moving documents and records and information into a format that isn't controlled by a single vendor. With ODF as an ISO/IEC standard (and likely to see much broader adoption now as a result), organizations don't have to worry about changes in file formats suddenly wreaking havoc with years of accumulated documents. If the application(s) they use with ODF are [Microsoft Office](http://www.microsoft.com/office/), StarOffice, [KOffice](http://www.koffice.org/), or OpenOffice, who cares? It's not really about the application, it's about the data.
