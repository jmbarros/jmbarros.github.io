I had the honor of speaking in front of the Denver VMUG on Tuesday of this week. It was a blast, and I got to meet a great group of people. I received some positive feedback on the presentation that I gave at the VMUG, so I thought I'd share it here as well.

Here is [a link to the presentation][1].

This is my first time using SlideShare, and I'll probably go back and update the slide deck here since some of the builds and formatting get lost in the conversion. If it's well-received by the readers, I'll likely post some other presentations I've given as well. Let me know your thoughts---both on the idea of embedding more presentations here as well as any thoughts on this particular presentation---in the comments below. Thanks!

**UPDATE:** During the migration to the new blog platform at the end of 2014, embedded presentations had to be changed to linked presentations.
