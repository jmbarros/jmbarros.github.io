I'm sure that others have already picked this up, but I thought it was worth mentioning that NetApp has added deduplication functionality to their virtual tape library (VTL) product line. The [official press release](http://www.netapp.com/us/company/news/news-rel-20081028.html) was published on October 28, 2008:

>NetApp (NASDAQ: NTAP) today announced the availability of deduplication on NetApp Virtual Tape Library (VTL) systems, enabling customers to lower the disk capacity required to backup any storage system, including EMC and HP, up to 95%1. NetApp delivers unparalleled cost savings for traditional backup environments by reducing tape media usage and tape drive infrastructure and, now, through highly efficient usage of VTL disk storage through deduplication. With the addition of deduplication on VTL, NetApp offers the most complete deduplication portfolio, spanning backup, archive, and primary storage applications.

Per the press release, it also appears that VTL deduplication will be available to both new and existing customers at no additional charge.

Check out the official press release for all the details.
