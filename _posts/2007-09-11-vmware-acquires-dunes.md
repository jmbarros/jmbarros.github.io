VMware has [announced](http://www.vmware.com/company/news/releases/dunes.html) that it has acquired [Dunes Technologies](http://www.dunes.ch/), a company that provides process automation and workflow in virtualized environments (the [Dunes announcement is here](http://www.dunes.ch/content/view/121/56/)). Virtualization.info broke the news about this [several days ago](http://www.virtualization.info/2007/09/vmware-acquired-dunes-technologies.html), and it was confirmed today with this press release. Presumably Dunes' technologies and products will be used to bulk up VMware Site Recovery Manager, Virtual Desktop Manager, and related VMware products.
