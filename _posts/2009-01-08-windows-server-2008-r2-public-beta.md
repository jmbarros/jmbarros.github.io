[Via DABCC](http://www.dabcc.com/article.aspx?id=9536), I found that the public beta of Windows Server 2008 R2 is now available. This new version includes a spate of new features, but I would imagine that Microsoft virtualization fans are most looking forward to the introduction of live migration with Hyper-V. This will bring the ability to shift VMs from one host to another with no downtime, as VMotion (VMware), XenMotion (Citrix), and LiveMigration (Virtual Iron) have been able to do for a while.

For more complete information on some of the new features that are slated to be included in Windows Server 2008 R2, check out the announcement [on the Windows Server Division Weblog](http://blogs.technet.com/windowsserver/archive/2009/01/07/announcing-windows-server-2008-r2-beta.aspx).
