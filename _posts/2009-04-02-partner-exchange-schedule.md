If you're traveling to Orlando to attend VMware Partner Exchange 2009 and are interested in meeting up with me while we're there, have a look at [this Google calendar](http://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=2a2febo6t250b03pau0s1t0crk%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America/New_York&pvttk=e7dda7d13a5d9e7494877aedec0d5501). All my meetings and sessions while I'm at Partner Exchange will be listed there, and I've updated it for everything scheduled so far. I found that this approach works well after using it quite successfully last year at VMworld 2008 in Las Vegas.

I look forward to seeing you there!
