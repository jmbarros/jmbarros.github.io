As you probably already know, I've been working extensively with Markdown (and MultiMarkdown) over the last few months, and it has rapidly become my preferred format for content creation. To help me more extensively leverage Markdown for all my content creation, I came across [this OmniOutliner plug-in](http://fletcherpenney.net/2011/10/omnioutliner_plugin) by Fletcher Penny that allows me to export outlines as Markdown.

The instructions on how to install this plug-in are vague, so here are the steps you need (verified on two different Mac laptops running OmniOutliner 3.10.3 on Snow Leopard 10.6.8):

1. Copy the Markdown.ooxsl folder (this is Fletcher's plug-in) into the `~/Library/Application Support/The Omni Group/OmniOutliner/Plug-Ins` directory.

2. Restart OmniOutliner, if it is running.

Once you install the plug-in, then you'll see two new options for exporting documents when you select File > Export:

* Markdown (Text)  
* Markdown (With Attachments)

Enjoy!
