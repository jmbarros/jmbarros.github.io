I'm a multi-protocol kind of guy. What does that mean? Basically, it means that I use more than just a web browser. Typically, I have multiple Internet clients running at any given time---a browser (typically [Camino](http://www.caminobrowser.org/), but sometimes Safari), an RSS reader ([NetNewsWire](http://www.newsgator.com/Individuals/NetNewsWire/)), an IM client ([Adium](http://www.adiumx.com/)), [Cocoalicious](http://alittledrop.com/cocoalicious/) (for managing [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us/) bookmarks), an IRC client ([Colloquy](http://www.colloquy.info)), and an e-mail client. In each of these areas, there are high-quality applications available to choose from. For example, if I didn't like Camino or Safari, I could always switch to [Opera](http://www.opera.com/products/desktop/) or [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/); if I didn't like NetNewsWire, I could switch to [NewsFire](http://www.newsfirerss.com/), [Shrook](http://www.utsire.com/shrook/), or [Vienna](http://www.opencommunity.co.uk/vienna2.php). I have options.

I also like to try to follow a small number of Usenet newsgroups. Unfortunately, this is one area where [Mac OS X](http://www.apple.com/macosx/) doesn't have a good set of high-quality applications. And that really stinks.

There's only one commercial Usenet client of which I am aware, and that's [Unison](http://www.panic.com/unison/) by [Panic](http://www.panic.com/). It's a decent application, but lacks offline support and the ability to connect to multiple servers simultaneously. In addition, the UI is a bit awkward to me, and I could really use some better searching functionality. I've been using Unison for a while and I'd love to see a major upgrade to the application...so Panic guys, what do you say?

I thought that [Nemo](http://www.malcom-mac.com/nemo/) was going to be a real contender, but it crashes on a regular basis, and has a number of bugs that make it pretty much unusable. It's a tremendous start, though, and I hope that the developer continues to refine the application. Once some of these bugs have been squashed, I will definitely consider purchasing the application, but as it is I'm not going to pay for beta software that is truly beta quality. There are a few unfinished open source efforts, like [Xnntp](http://www.edv-consulting-berlin.de/Xnntp/), but those also are incomplete beta-quality products.

So are there any other good, high-quality NNTP/Usenet clients out there that I'm just missing? Or is this all there is?
