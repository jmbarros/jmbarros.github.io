My final article in the virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) series at [SearchVMware.com](http://searchvmware.techtarget.com/) has been published!

From the article, ["Networks, host OSes strained by VMware VDI deployments"](http://searchvmware.techtarget.com/tip/0,289483,sid179_gci1301164,00.html):

>Deploying Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) on VMware Infrastructure 3 (VI3) can have a considerable impact on your network design and hosted operating system (OS) instances.

The article goes on to discuss specific ways in which the network and the guest operating systems have to be architected in a VDI deployment. I hope you find the information useful!
