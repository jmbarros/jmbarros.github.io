Long-time readers know that since VMworld 2008 in Las Vegas, my wife Crystal has been organizing spouse activities---aka "Spousetivities"--for spouses, partners, family members, and friends traveling with VMworld conference attendees. This is a true labor of love for Crystal; she works tirelessly to gather sponsors, organize activities, and handle the logistics for the events. Although registration is opening a bit later than usual this year (Crystal's been sick and in the hospital recently), [registration for Spousetivities at VMworld 2014 in San Francisco is now open](http://vmworld2014-spousetivities.eventbrite.com).

Here's a quick peek at some of the activities she's organized:

* The annual "Get to Know You" breakfast, where Spousetivities participants get to meet the other folks they'll be hanging out with for the week, as well as possibly win some great prizes

* Mission Street food tour

* Kayaking on the Russian River

* Wine tours (Crystal's still sorting details on this one, so tickets aren't available yet---but check back often!)

* Whale watching

Crystal's also working on adding some additional activities; as details for those become available, she'll let the community know.

Although this is a labor of love for Crystal, it takes sponsors to make it happen. This year, VMworld's first and only _community-driven_ and _community-focused_ spouse activities are brought to you by these sponsors:

* [Origami Owl](http://crystallowe.origamiowl.com/collections.ashx)

* [Wine Shop at Home](http://www.wineshopathome.com/sharikeen/)

* [The Virtualization Practice](http://www.thevirtualizationpractice.com/)

* [HyTrust](http://www.hytrust.com/)

* [VMUG](http://www.vmug.com/)

* [vBackup](http://www.vbackup.com/)

* [VMware NSX](http://www.vmware.com/go/nsx/)

If you appreciate the fact that your loved ones will have someone to watch out for them and something to do while you're at the conference this year, please let the Spousetivities sponsors know. Visit their booths, or give them a shout-out on Twitter or Facebook.

Interested in signing up? Registration for Spousetivities is available [here](http://vmworld2014-spousetivities.eventbrite.com). Interested in being a sponsor? Drop me an e-mail (see [my About page][about]) and I'll get you connected with more information.
