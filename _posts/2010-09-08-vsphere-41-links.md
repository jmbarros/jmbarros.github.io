I'd collected a long list of vSphere 4.1-related links as part of the process of revising _Mastering VMware vSphere 4_, a project that has since [been shelved][1]. Rather than just delete the links now that the book is no longer being revised, I thought I'd post them here (in no particular order) just in case someone else might find them useful.
