Reader Scott Merrill pointed out something to me in an e-mail regarding a Registry change that might be necessary in some Active Directory integration scenarios:

>Finally, I would like to share one registry change that we've found to be necessary in our AD integration. By default, the MS LDAP server only returns 1,000 results. As a university department with more than 1000 active students, this limitation has caused us some frustration.

introduce additional problems down the road, but at least it lets me fully enumerate all our AD users from a Linux machine with `getent passwd`.

If you have an Active Directory domain with more than 1,000 users in the DN specified in your LDAP configuration, then this is a Registry change you'll want to investigate. Otherwise, you could find that your UNIX/Linux servers aren't able to fully enumerate all the users in the domain.

Thanks, Scott!
