Rather than posting some sort of "2011 in review" article where I talk about how many visitors the site had or how many RSS subscribers there are, I thought I'd instead focus on the upcoming year and some of the projects in which I'll be involved. By describing some of the projects that I'm undertaking this year in 2012, that gives you---the readers---a rough idea of some of the types of content that will likely appear in the coming year.

Here are some of my 2012 projects (some of these I've already tweeted about):

1. I'm going to learn to script in Perl. Many people have asked why Perl and why not Python or Ruby or something else. Honestly, I don't have a really good answer for you. I tried (unsuccessfully) to teach myself Perl a couple of years ago, so I still have the O'Reilly _Learning Perl_ book. Rather than spending money to learn some other scripting language, it seemed reasonable to revisit Perl again and just leverage the resources I already have. You might see a few Perl-related posts here and there as I work through _Learning Perl_, but I'll try not to bore you with elementary stuff.

2. I'm going to learn German. Same scenario here---many people have asked why German and why not Spanish or French. I do have an answer this time: I seem to be spending a fair amount of time in Vienna, so German seemed to make sense. I also have a series of customer meetings planned in Germany in the first quarter of this year. Plus, German is completely new and different than anything I've learned before, and I wanted to challenge myself to learn and think in new ways. It's unlikely that this will find its way into any blog posts, but you never know

3. I'm going to become much more familiar with the Xen hypervisor. I haven't yet decided if I'll focus strictly on the open source version of Xen or Citrix XenServer; I'm open to suggestions there. No, this doesn't mean that I'm abandoning VMware or anything like that; I just want to expand my knowledge. You can't simply discount Xen; after all, Amazon EC2 is built on Xen. Along with this dive into Xen, I'll also be looking very closely at Open vSwitch and OpenStack. I'd expect that a great deal of this education will eventually end up in various blog posts here.

4. I'm going to pursue my CCNP. I "re-achieved" CCNA last year, and this year I'm pursuing my CCNP. As with Xen, I'm confident that the learning curve required to move closer to (or even achieve) CCNP will result in a number of related blog posts on various networking technologies or concepts.

I do have a few other projects planned for this upcoming year, but I'm not quite ready to discuss those publicly yet. At least one of these other projects will be something new that I haven't done before. Stretching myself and my skills/experience in new directions is a bit of a theme this year.

If you have any tips/tricks/advice to share on any of these upcoming projects, or if there are specific things related to these projects that you'd like to see blogged about here, please let me know in the comments. Thanks, and I hope that 2012 is going to be as exciting for you as it will be for me!
