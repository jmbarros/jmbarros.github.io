Here are some VMworld links that I've been collecting over the last day or so. As I have time, I'll try to expand upon them and add my own thoughts and views, but wanted to mention them here briefly, at least:

* [VMworld 2007: Embedded ESX a can of worms](http://servervirtualization.blogs.techtarget.com/2007/09/10/vmworld-2007-embedded-esx-a-can-of-worms/): Alex Barrett of SearchServerVirtualization.com comments on the release of ESX Server 3i and what impact it may have on the usage of ESX Server in the enterprise. Certainly it _will_ have an impact, but I think the impact will be greater for third-party vendors than for IT managers.

* [VMworld 2007: ESX price is not the problem](http://servervirtualization.blogs.techtarget.com/2007/09/10/vmworld-2007-esx-price-is-not-the-problem/)

* [VMworld 2007: VMware users say, "Lower prices"](http://servervirtualization.blogs.techtarget.com/2007/09/10/vmworld-2007-vmware-users-say-lower-prices/): So are prices an issue, or not? The guys and gals at TechTarget seem to be reporting conflicting views. I'll have to delve into this in a bit more detail.

* [Open Virtual Machine Format Specification (OVF) Submitted to DMTF](http://xml.coverpages.org/ni2007-09-11-a.html): The OVF was announced earlier at VMworld 2007, but no details have really surfaced (at least, none that I've seen yet---feel free to forward information you may have found on OVF).

* [VMworld 2007: bigger, broader and Viridian](http://blogs.technet.com/windowsserver/archive/2007/09/11/vmworld-2007-bigger-broader-and-viridian.aspx): VMworld, strangely enough, isn't just about VMware, so here's some information from Microsoft on their developing hypervisor, code-named "Viridian". Here's another blurb about [virtualization security](http://blogs.technet.com/windowsserver/archive/2007/09/11/VMworld-2007_3A00_-virtualization-security.aspx) as well.

I'll try to add some more information and my thoughts on some of these issues as soon as possible. In the meantime, I'm off to my final session here at VMworld 2007 on Day 2!
