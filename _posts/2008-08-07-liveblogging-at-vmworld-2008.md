While it should be fairly obvious from the discussions about [spouse activities at VMworld][1], I am attending VMworld 2008 in Las Vegas, and I do plan on liveblogging as much of the conference as is humanly possible. That will depend upon a great many factors, of course, but I hope to be able to provide at least the same level of coverage for VMworld 2008 as I did for Tech-Ed back in June. As I've done in the past, I'll post my VMworld schedule here once it is finalized so that readers will have an idea of what sessions I'm planning on attending. I'm certainly open to suggestions from fellow attendees on potential sessions.

To keep track of all VMworld 2008-related content, you can use the ["VMworld2008" content tag][2] to view all the pertinent articles. Hopefully, that will make finding the content a bit easier.
