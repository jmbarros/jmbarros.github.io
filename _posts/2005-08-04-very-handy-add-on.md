I just found a _**very**_ handy add-on for Mac OS X. It's called [RDC Menu](http://www.xutils.com/rdcmenu/) and it is a tool that provides an easy way of launching multiple instances of Microsoft's [Remote Desktop Connection](http://www.microsoft.com/mac/otherproducts/otherproducts.aspx?pid=remotedesktopclient) application for the Mac. If you manage Windows-based networks, you already know how useful Remote Desktop Connection (RDC) is, but the one key flaw in RDC was that you couldn't launch multiple instances and thus couldn't be connected to more than one Windows computer at a time. With RDC Menu, all that changes. Working as either a Dock item or as a Menu Extra, it allows you to easily launch multiple instances of RDC to connect to multiple Windows-based systems. I run RDC Menu as a Dock item (I don't like too many Menu Extras).
