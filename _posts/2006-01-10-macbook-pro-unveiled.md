As expected today, Steve Jobs unveiled the [MacBook Pro](http://www.apple.com/macbookpro/), the next generation of Apple Mac OS X-based notebooks built around the new Intel Core Duo dual-core CPU.

The specs are pretty impressive. Either 1.67GHz or 1.83GHz dual-core CPUs, 667MHz front-side bus, up to 2GB of RAM, SATA hard drives, SuperDrive, built-in iSight, new MagSafe power connector, built-in AirPort Extreme and Bluetooth, etc., etc. Almost all the goodies a Mac lover could want, except one thing: a built-in docking solution. Argh!

Nevertheless, I have only one thing to say: Gimme one!
