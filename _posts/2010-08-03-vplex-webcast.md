Next Thursday, August 12, I'll be hosting an EMC Live webcast titled "Disaster Avoidance with VMware vSphere and VPLEX". The webcast is part of EMC's weekly VMware-focused webcasts. We'll be starting next Thursday, August 12, at 8AM Pacific/11AM Eastern/4PM BST.

As you can tell by the name, I'll be discussing EMC VPLEX and how you can use VPLEX to potentially build a DR-avoidance scenario for your virtualized environment. If you're interested in learning more, register for the webcast [here](http://info.emc.com/mk/get/DBM8190-9808_raf_lp?reg_src=WEB_Blog_Scott_Lowe). Thanks!
