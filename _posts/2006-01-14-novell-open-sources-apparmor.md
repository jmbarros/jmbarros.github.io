Last week, [Novell](http://www.novell.com/) open sourced the [AppArmor](http://www.opensuse.org/Apparmor) software under the GPL, hoping to promote adoption and development of the security framework for Linux. I was alerted to the move by a number of articles on the subject, such as [this article from ComputerWorld](http://www.computerworld.com/securitytopics/security/story/0,10801,107617,00.html) and [this article from eWeek](http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1909552,00.asp).

AppArmor competes with Security Enhanced Linux, or SELinux, which---due to its complexity---is often turned off completely. Clearly, Novell hopes to gain some traction by opening up the source code to AppArmor and providing it to anyone to download. The software is also being included with [OpenSUSE](http://www.opensuse.org/) and SLES.

If AppArmor is easier to configure and use than SELinux yet provides comparable enhancements to security, I'll certainly take a much closer look at it for deployment on my Linux servers.
