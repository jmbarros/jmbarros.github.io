When I first started using [virtual desktops with Mac OS X][1], I went through a couple of different iterations before settling on an application called Virtue (later to be renamed [VirtueDesktops](http://www.virtuedesktops.info/)). Although it took some time to get used to the idea of not having a desktop pager window always present, the hotkey for popping up VirtueDesktops' translucent pager became almost as ingrained in my fingers as the hotkey for Quicksilver (note I said "almost").

After [a near death experience][2] around the release of Tiger, VirtueDesktops progressed steadily until just last week, Tony Arnold [announced](http://virtuedesktops.info/index.php/2007/03/11/virtuedesktops-the-end-for-now/) that he was [ceasing the development](http://forums.cocoaforge.com/viewtopic.php?t=12392) of VirtueDesktops. I can understand his position; with [Spaces](http://www.apple.com/macosx/leopard/spaces.html) set to debut in Leopard, it's difficult to justify the continued development of a virtual desktop application. Given that VirtueDesktops is an open source application, though, there's hope that another developer will pick up the source code---much like Tony did himself after Virtue was abandoned by the previous developer---and continue the project.

I mostly stopped using VirtueDesktops after [switching to my MacBook Pro][3]. I guess the problems that the application experienced during the transition to a Universal application scared me away from it, and it's only been recently that I started using it again on occasion. Since then, I've gotten used to using [Expos](http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/expose/) to manage windows instead of spreading them around multiple desktops, and I don't know if I'll ever switch back on a full-time basis. Nevertheless, I appreciate Tony and his hard work on the application, which served me very well for quite some time. I wish Tony the best of luck in his future projects and I hope, for the sake of other VirtueDesktops users, that one or more talented developers will take up the mantle and continue development.
