Via Tarry at [Virtualization for Everyone](http://tarrysingh.blogspot.com/2008/03/vmware-workstation-603-released.html) (and numerous others), I saw that VMware has updated VMware Workstation to version 6.0.3, which is primarily an update release to address various security issues and add a few new features. More information is available [here](http://www.vmware.com/support/ws6/doc/releasenotes_ws6.html).
