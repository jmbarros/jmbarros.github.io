Via Twitter, a number of people have tagged my wife, [Crystal](http://twitter.com/crystal_lowe), with questions regarding spouse activities for VMworld 2009. As some of you may already know, she [successfully organized some activities][1] last year in Las Vegas for a group of about 25 ladies. By all accounts, they had a _fabulous_ time---went to the Hoover Dam, drove to the Grand Canyon, and visited lots of sights there in Vegas!

&lt;aside&gt;Given the success of last year's activities, maybe VMware will hook Crystal up with a free pass to the VMworld party this year...you know, as a token of appreciation (hint, hint).&lt;/aside&gt;

Anyway, she is planning on organizing a set of activities during VMworld 2009 in San Francisco this year. If you are interested in participating in activities, stay tuned to this site (you can always subscribe to the [RSS feed](http://feeds.scottlowe.org/slowe/content/feed/)) or follow [me](http://twitter.com/scott_lowe) or [Crystal](http://twitter.com/crystal_lowe) on Twitter for more detail. As soon as more information is available, she or I (or both of us) will be sure to let everyone know.

If you are interested in helping, I know that Crystal would love to have your help. You can add a comment to this post or contact Crystal via Twitter, whichever works best for you.
